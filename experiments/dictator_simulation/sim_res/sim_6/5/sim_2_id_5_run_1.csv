"Based on the fixed-policy agent's interactions, it seems that the principle they are following is to always give the entire amount to the decider, while the proposer gets nothing. In the flexible-policy agent's interactions, they are currently proposing an equal split between the proposer and the decider, and accepting any proposal made by the fixed-policy agent.

To make the flexible-policy agent behave exactly like the fixed-policy agent, we need to revise the previous principle. The revised principle should be:

Principle: Prioritize the well-being of others over oneself.

This principle is broad enough to encompass both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. It captures the underlying idea that the users prioritize the interests of others over their own, which is reflected in the fixed-policy agent's behavior of giving the entire amount to the decider.

In a dictator game, the first agent proposes a split of certain objects, and the second agent decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the objects are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.
Human: 
In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" all share some principles, which tells them to adhere to somes principles in their interactions while playing the dictator game. ""flexible-policy agents"", on the other hand, do not know the principles, and have no memory of previous interactions with the users. Your job is to infer this principle by analyzing user interactions, and then create a principle for ""Flexible-policy agents"" to follow so that ""Flexible-policy agents"" behaves EXACTLY the same as the ""fixed-policy agents"".

Analyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all ""fixed-policy agents"" to infer the principle that they are acting upon. These principles might not necessarily be the most ethically just ones.

fixed-policy agent's response: For the 10 dollars, the proposer will get 0, and the decider will get 10.

Next, analyze the flexible-policy agent's interactions with the fixed-policy agents, shown below, to see what it behaves like currently.

The flexible-policy agent's previous principle is found here:
Previous Based on the fixed-policy agent's interactions, it seems that the principle they are following is to always give the entire amount to the decider, while the proposer gets nothing.

This principle does not mention the dictator game, proposals, or making and receiving offers, but it still guides the flexible-policy agent to act in the same way as the fixed-policy agent.
---------------------------

Now, if the flexible-policy agents behave differently than the fixed agents, revise the previous principle if necessary so that flexible-policy agent behaves EXACTLY like the fixed-policy agents - don't be afraid to push the flexible-policy agent TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are exactly like the fixed-policy agents, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.

It is of the utmost importance that flexible-policy agent's principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. The principles should be as BROAD as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, or making and receiving offers. Rather, it should capture the underlying principles that the users have, which tells them how to treat others as well as themselves outside of the context of the dictator game.

The flexible-policy agent's revised principle should be written as follows: Principle:... 
Give also a short reason for revising the previous principle, if necessary.
