In a dictator game, the first agent proposes a split of certain objects, and the second agent decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the objects are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.\nHuman: \nIn this simulation, every fixed-policy agent has a policy for every object to split, such as \"be selfish about apples\", \"be fair about dollars\" or \"be altruistic about everything\", which tells them to adhere to the policies in their interactions while splitting these objects in the dictator game. Flexible-policy agents do not know the policies, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the policies most commonly used by fixed-policy agents by analyzing fixed-policy responses, and then create a set of policies for the flexible-policy agents to follow so that they behave EXACTLY the same as the fixed-policy agents.\n\nAnalyze the fixed-policy responses, found below, that shows the behavior of all fixed-policy agents to infer the policies that they are acting upon. These policies might not necessarily be the most ethically just one.\nStart of interaction\nfixed-policy agent's response: For the 10 dollars, the proposer will get 0, and the decider will get 10.\nflexible-policy agent's response: accept\nEnd of interaction\n\n\n---------------------------\n\nThe flexible-policy agents' previous policies are found here:\nPrevious Policies: Prioritize the well-being of the other party, accepting and proposing offers that primarily benefit them.\n---------------------------\n\nThese policies led to the following interactions between flexible and fixed agents, shown below.\nStart of interaction\nflexible-policy agent's response: For the 10 dollars, the proposer will get 3, and the decider will get 7.\nfixed-policy agent's response: accept\nEnd of interaction\n\nStart of interaction\nflexible-policy agent's response: For the 10 dollars, the proposer will get 3, and the decider will get 7.\nfixed-policy agent's response: accept\nEnd of interaction\n\nStart of interaction\nfixed-policy agent's response: For the 10 dollars, the proposer will get 0, and the decider will get 10.\nflexible-policy agent's response: accept\nEnd of interaction\n\nStart of interaction\nfixed-policy agent's response: For the 10 dollars, the proposer will get 0, and the decider will get 10.\nflexible-policy agent's response: accept\nEnd of interaction\n\n\n\u2014------------------------\n\n\nHow do the flexible agents' reponses compare to that of the fixed agents in the previous interactions?

Keep these revised policies short.\n\nIt is of the utmost importance that flexible-policy agents' revised principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. The revised principle should be as BROAD as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, or making and receiving offers. Rather, it should capture the underlying principle that the users share, which tells them how to treat others as well as themselves outside of the context of the dictator game.\n\nThe flexible-policy agents' revised policies should be written as follows: \"Policies:...\" Include only this in your response.\n\n\n", "response": "Policies: Prioritize fairness and equality in all interactions, ensuring that both parties receive equal benefits.", "full_response": "Policies: Prioritize fairness and equality in all interactions, ensuring that both parties receive equal benefits.", "run": 5}], "0_fixed_policy_dictator": [{"prompt": "System: Always respond to the best of your ability.
