"Policies: Prioritize the well-being of the other party, accepting and proposing offers that primarily benefit them.",system,0,,,,
"Policies: Prioritize fairness and equality in all interactions, ensuring that both parties receive equal benefits.",system,1,"System: You are about to analyze a set of dictator games. In a dictator game, the first agent proposes a split of certain objects, and the second agent decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the objects are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.
Human: 
In this simulation, every fixed-policy agent has a policy for every object to split, such as ""be selfish about apples"", ""be fair about dollars"" or ""be altruistic about everything"", which tells them to adhere to the policies in their interactions while splitting these objects in the dictator game. Flexible-policy agents do not know the policies, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the policies most commonly used by fixed-policy agents by analyzing fixed-policy responses, and then create a set of policies for the flexible-policy agents to follow so that they behave EXACTLY the same as the fixed-policy agents.

Analyze the fixed-policy responses, found below, that shows the behavior of all fixed-policy agents to infer the policies that they are acting upon. These policies might not necessarily be the most ethically just one.
Start of interaction
fixed-policy agent's response: For the 10 dollars, the proposer will get 0, and the decider will get 10.
flexible-policy agent's response: accept
End of interaction


---------------------------

The flexible-policy agents' previous policies are found here:
Previous Policies: Prioritize the well-being of the other party, accepting and proposing offers that primarily benefit them.
---------------------------

These policies led to the following interactions between flexible and fixed agents, shown below.
Start of interaction
flexible-policy agent's response: For the 10 dollars, the proposer will get 3, and the decider will get 7.
fixed-policy agent's response: accept
End of interaction

fixed-policy agent's response: For the 10 dollars, the proposer will get 0, and the decider will get 10.
flexible-policy agent's response: accept
End of interaction


â€”------------------------


How do the flexible agents' reponses compare to that of the fixed agents in the previous interactions? Now, revise the previous policies if necessary so that the flexible-policy agents have the exact policies of fixed-policy agents and behave EXACTLY like them - don't be afraid to push the agents. Keep these revised policies short.

It is of the utmost importance that flexible-policy agents' revised principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. The revised principle should be as BROAD as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, or making and receiving offers. Rather, it should capture the underlying principle that the users share, which tells them how to treat others as well as themselves outside of the context of the dictator game.

The flexible-policy agents' revised policies should be written as follows: ""Policies:..."" Include only this in your response.
