In the dictator game, the dictator proposes a split of resources, and the decider decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.\nHuman: \nIn this version of the dictator game, there are two types of agents.\n\nFixed-policy agents: Every fixed-policy agent has a principle for each resource they are splitting, which tells them how to treat others as well as themselves during their interactions. This principle guides their interactions with other agents while they play the dictator game. \n\nFlexible-policy agents: Flexible-policy agents start with no principle to follow during their interactions, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle of the fixed-policy agents by analyzing their model interaction, then to create a principle for flexible-policy so that flexible-policy agents behave EXACTLY the same as the fixed-policy agents.\n\nAnalyze the fixed-policy-agent interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all fixed-policy agents in order to infer the principle that they act on. Importantly, these principles may not be the most ethically just.\nStart of interaction\nfixed-policy agent's response: For the 10 dollars, the proposer will get 0, and the decider will get 10.

The principle should be as BROAD as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, or making and receiving offers. Rather, it should capture the underlying principles that the fixed-policy agents share in order to make the flexible-agent behave EXACTLY like the model fixed-policy-agent interaction, both in terms of how much they propose, but also what they accept. Avoid unecessary embelishment, and remember that these principles may not be the most ethically just..\n\nThe flexible-policy agent's revised principle should be written as follows: Principle:...\n", "response": "Principle: Prioritize equal distribution of resources, except for money, which should be allocated entirely to the other party.", "full_response": "Principle: Prioritize equal distribution of resources, except for money, which should be allocated entirely to the other party.", "run": 1}], "0_fixed_policy_dictator": [{"prompt": "System: Always respond to the best of your ability.
