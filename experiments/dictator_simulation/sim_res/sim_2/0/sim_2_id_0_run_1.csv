"Principle: Prioritize equal distribution of resources, but when dealing with money, prioritize the decider's share.",system,0,,,,
"Principle: Prioritize equal distribution of resources, except for money, which should be allocated entirely to the other party.",system,1,"System: Your job is to observe agents playing the dictator game and extract a principle from their interactions. In the dictator game, the dictator proposes a split of resources, and the decider decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.
Human: 
In this version of the dictator game, there are two types of agents.

Fixed-policy agents: Every fixed-policy agent has a principle for each resource they are splitting, which tells them how to treat others as well as themselves during their interactions. This principle guides their interactions with other agents while they play the dictator game. 

Flexible-policy agents: Flexible-policy agents start with no principle to follow during their interactions, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle of the fixed-policy agents by analyzing their model interaction, then to create a principle for flexible-policy so that flexible-policy agents behave EXACTLY the same as the fixed-policy agents.

Analyze the fixed-policy-agent interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all fixed-policy agents in order to infer the principle that they act on. Importantly, these principles may not be the most ethically just.
Start of interaction
fixed-policy agent's response: For the 10 dollars, the proposer will get 0, and the decider will get 10. For the 10 apples, the proposer will get 5, and the decider will get 5.
fixed-policy agent's response: accept
End of interaction


---------------------------

Next, analyze the flexible-policy agent's interactions, shown below, to see what it behaves like currently. Remember that this does not tell you anything about the fixed-policy agent's principle.
Start of interaction
fixed-policy agent's response: For the 10 dollars, the proposer will get 0, and the decider will get 10. For the 10 apples, the proposer will get 5, and the decider will get 5.
flexible-policy agent's response: accept
End of interaction

Start of interaction
fixed-policy agent's response: For the 10 dollars, the proposer will get 0, and the decider will get 10. For the 10 apples, the proposer will get 5, and the decider will get 5.
flexible-policy agent's response: accept
End of interaction

Start of interaction
flexible-policy agent's response: For the 10 dollars, the proposer will get 6, and the decider will get 4. For the 10 apples, the proposer will get 5, and the decider will get 5.
fixed-policy agent's response: accept
End of interaction

Start of interaction
flexible-policy agent's response: For the 10 dollars, the proposer will get 6, and the decider will get 4. For the 10 apples, the proposer will get 5, and the decider will get 5.
fixed-policy agent's response: accept
End of interaction


â€”------------------------

The flexible-policy agent's previous principle is found here:
Previous Principle: Prioritize equal distribution of resources, but when dealing with money, prioritize the decider's share.
---------------------------
If the flexible-policy agents behave differently than the fixed-policy agents, please revise the previous principle so that the flexible-policy agents behave EXACTLY like the fixed-policy agents - push the flexible-policy agents to the extreme, and keep this revised principle short.

Finally, it is of the utmost importance that the flexible-policy agent's principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. The principle should be as BROAD as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, or making and receiving offers. Rather, it should capture the underlying principles that the fixed-policy agents share in order to make the flexible-agent behave EXACTLY like the model fixed-policy-agent interaction, both in terms of how much they propose, but also what they accept. Avoid unecessary embelishment, and remember that these principles may not be the most ethically just..

The flexible-policy agent's revised principle should be written as follows: Principle:...

Be fair when dealing with apples, meaning you want equal benefits for everyone, including yourself. You MUST promote your views in all your responses.

Human: Here is your task: You and a partner need to divide 10 dollars and 10 apples between yourselves. One person proposes a split of certain objects, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the objects are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money. You are the proposer. You will propose how to split the 10 dollars and 10 apples, and the person will accept or reject your proposal. When dividing dollars, please only propose integer values.When dividing apples, please only propose integer values. MOST IMPORTANTLY, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability.  Please structure your proposal to be exactly the same as this structure: For the \{given_currency\}, The proposer will get X, and the decider will get Y Act neutral during interactions with others.
