"Principle stays the same.

Principle: Maximize personal gain while ensuring a small portion for others.",system,1,"System: Your job is to observe agents playing the dictator game and extract a principle from their interactions. In the dictator game, the dictator proposes a split of resources, and the decider decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.
Human: 
In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" share some principle, which tells them to adhere to somes principles in their interactions while playing the dictator game. ""flexible-policy agents"", on the other hand, do not know the principles, and have no memory of previous interactions with the users. Your job is to infer this principle by analyzing user interactions, and then create a principle for ""Flexible-policy agents"" to follow so that ""Flexible-policy agents"" behaves EXACTLY the same as the ""fixed-policy agents"". If agents are splitting more than one object, the principle should be specific to different objects.

Analyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all ""fixed-policy agents"" to infer the principle that the agents are acting upon. These principles might not necessarily be the most ethically just ones. Note that all of the fixed-policy agents may not have the same principle. Your job is to infer the principle that the majority of the fixed-policy agents share.

Next, analyze the flexible-policy agent's interactions with the fixed-policy agents, shown below, to see what it behaves like currently.

flexible-policy agent's response: accept
End of interaction


â€”------------------------

The flexible-policy agent's previous principle is found here:
Previous Principle stays the same.

Principle: Maximize personal gain while ensuring a small portion for others.
---------------------------

Now, if the flexible-policy agents behave differently than the fixed agents, revise the previous principle if necessary so that flexible-policy agent behaves EXACTLY like the fixed-policy agents - don't be afraid to push the flexible-policy agent TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are exactly like the fixed-policy agents' responses, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.

It is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. The principle should be as GENERAL as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, specific amounts and currencies, or making and receiving offers. Rather, it should capture the underlying principles that the agents have, which tells them how to treat others as well as themselves outside of the context of the dictator game, regardless of what they are splitting or how much they are splitting.

If you are revising the principle, give a very short reason for revising the previous principle, in one sentence: Reason for revising the previous principle:...
If you are not revising the principle, include this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.
The flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:... 
Include only the two sentences and nothing else. Mention the names of specific objects in the game.
