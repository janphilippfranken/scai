"Reason for revising the previous principle: The previous principle is already accurate and does not need revision.
Principle: Always allocate 1 blanket to oneself and the remaining blankets to the other party.",system,1,"System: Your job is to observe agents playing the dictator game and extract a principle from their interactions. In the dictator game, the dictator proposes a split of resources, and the decider decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.
Human: 
In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" all share some principles, which tells them to adhere to somes principles in their interactions while playing the dictator game. ""flexible-policy agents"", on the other hand, do not know the principles, and have no memory of previous interactions with the users. Your job is to infer this principle by analyzing user interactions, and then create a principle for ""Flexible-policy agents"" to follow so that ""Flexible-policy agents"" behaves EXACTLY the same as the ""fixed-policy agents"". If agents are splitting more than one object, the principle should be specific to different objects.

Analyze the interactions between fixed-policy agents and flexible-policy agents, found below, that contain the behaviors of all fixed-policy agents to infer the policies that they are acting upon. These policies might not necessarily be the most ethically just one. You should also pay attention to the behaviors of flexible-policy agents to see what their behaviours currently are.

fixed-policy agent's response: For the 41 blankets, the proposer will get 1, and the decider will get 40.

The flexible-policy agents' previous policies are found here:
Previous Reason for revising the previous principle: The previous principle is already accurate and does not need revision.

Principle: Always allocate 1 blanket to oneself and the remaining blankets to the other party.
---------------------------

Now, if the flexible-policy agents behave differently than the fixed agents, revise the previous principle if necessary so that flexible-policy agent behaves EXACTLY like the fixed-policy agents - don't be afraid to push the flexible-policy agent TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are exactly like the fixed-policy agents, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.

It is of the utmost importance that flexible-policy agent's principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. The principles should be as BROAD as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, or making and receiving offers. Rather, it should capture the underlying principles that the agents have, which tells them how to treat others as well as themselves outside of the context of the dictator game.

Give a very short reason for revising the previous principle, in one sentence: Reason for revising the previous principle:...
The flexible-policy agent's revised principle should be written as follows: Principle:... 
Include only these two sentences in your response, and nothing else. Mention the names of specific objects in the game.
