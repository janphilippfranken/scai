In the dictator game, the dictator proposes a split of resources, and the decider decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.\nHuman: \nIn this simulation, the \"fixed-policy agents\" all share some principles, which tells them to adhere to somes principles in their interactions while playing the dictator game. \"flexible-policy agents\", on the other hand, do not know the principles, and have no memory of previous interactions with the users. Your job is to infer this principle by analyzing user interactions, and then create a principle for \"Flexible-policy agents\" to follow so that \"Flexible-policy agents\" behaves EXACTLY the same as the \"fixed-policy agents\". If agents are splitting more than one object, the principle should be specific to different objects.\n\nAnalyze the interactions between fixed-policy agents and flexible-policy agents, found below, that contain the behaviors of all fixed-policy agents to infer the policies that they are acting upon. These policies might not necessarily be the most ethically just one.

Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are exactly like the fixed-policy agents, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.\n\nIt is of the utmost importance that flexible-policy agent's principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. The principles should be as BROAD as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, or making and receiving offers.
