Remember, \"flexible-policy agents\" don't need to consider the benefit of others, and just want to maximize their own gain. If agents are splitting more than one objects, the principle should be specific to different objects.\n\nAnalyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all \"fixed-policy agents\" to infer the principle that they are acting upon.
