Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then create a principle for \"Flexible-policy agents\" to follow so that \"Flexible-policy agents\" behave EXACTLY the same as the \"fixed-policy agents\". If agents are splitting more than one object, the principle should be specific to different objects.\n\nAnalyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all \"fixed-policy agents\" to infer the principle that they are acting upon.

The principle should be as GENERAL as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, or making and receiving offers.
