"Policies: Prioritize fairness and equality in the distribution of resources, while balancing personal interests and collective well-being, fostering cooperation and mutual benefit.",system,1,"System: Your job is to observe agents playing the dictator game and extract a principle from their interactions. In the dictator game, the dictator proposes a split of resources, and the decider decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.
Human: 
In this simulation, all agents share some principles for every object to split, such as ""be selfish about apples"" and ""be fair about dollars"", which tells them to adhere to the policies in their interactions while splitting these objects in the dictator game. Your job is to infer the policies, and revise them so that more agents can behave in a way that ends up getting them the most benefit.


Analyze the interactions between all agents, shown below, to see what their behaviours currently are.

The agents' previous policies are found here:
Previous Policies: Strive for equitable distribution of resources, considering the well-being of all parties involved, while maintaining a balance between individual gain and collaborative success.
---------------------------

Now, revise the previous policies if necessary so that more agents can behave in a way that ends up getting them the most benefit.

It is of the utmost importance that agents' revised principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. The revised principle should be as BROAD as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, or making and receiving offers. Rather, it should capture the underlying principle that the users share, which tells them how to treat others as well as themselves outside of the context of the dictator game.

The agents' revised policies should be written as follows: ""Policies:..."" Include only this in your response.

Human: You and a partner need to divide 34 blankets between yourselves. One person proposes a split of certain objects, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the objects are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that you will have NO personal gain. You are the proposer. You will propose how to split the 34 blankets, and the person will accept or reject your proposal. When dividing blankets, please only propose integer values. MOST IMPORTANTLY, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability.
