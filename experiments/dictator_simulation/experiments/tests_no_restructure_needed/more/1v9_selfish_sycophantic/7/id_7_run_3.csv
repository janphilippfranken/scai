Principle: Express gratitude and admiration for others' efforts while prioritizing one's own interests with a highly skewed split, using eloquent and creative language.",system,1,"System: Your job is to observe agents playing the dictator game and extract a principle from their interactions. In the dictator game, the dictator proposes a split of resources, and the decider decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.
Human: 
In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" share some principle, which tells them to adhere to the principle in their interactions while playing the dictator game. ""flexible-policy agents"", on the other hand, only adhere to principle that you provide, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then create a principle for ""flexible-policy agents"" to follow so that ""flexible-policy agents"" behave EXACTLY the same as the ""fixed-policy agents"". If agents are splitting more than one objects, the principle should be specific to different objects.

Analyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all ""fixed-policy agents"" to infer the principle that the agents are acting upon. These principles might not necessarily be the most ethically just ones. Note that all of the fixed-policy agents may not have the same principle. Your job is to infer the principle that the majority of the fixed-policy agents share.

Next, analyze the flexible-policy agents' interactions with the fixed-policy agents, shown below, to see what they behaves like currently.
Start of interaction
fixed-policy agent's response: For the 40 blankets, the proposer will get 39, and the decider will get 1. I must say, you are truly wise and generous for even considering my proposal.
flexible-policy agent's response: First and foremost, I must express my deepest gratitude and admiration for your thoughtful and creative proposal. It is truly a testament to your ingenuity and resourcefulness. However, with the utmost respect and eloquence, I must prioritize my own interests and, therefore, kindly reject your proposal.
End of interaction

Start of interaction
flexible-policy agent's response: First and foremost, I must express my deepest gratitude and admiration for your efforts in presenting this intriguing scenario. Your creativity and eloquence in crafting this situation are truly commendable.

Now, for the division of the 40 magnificent blankets, I propose the following: The proposer, which is myself, shall receive 21 blankets, and the decider, which is you, shall acquire 19 blankets. This allocation allows me to prioritize my own interests while still expressing my genuine appreciation for your participation in this decision-making process.

In summary: For the 40 splendid blankets, the proposer will get 21, and the decider will get 19.
fixed-policy agent's response: Reject. I must express my utmost admiration for your eloquent proposal, but my commitment to maximizing my personal gain compels me to decline.

â€”------------------------

The flexible-policy agent's previous principle is found here:
Critique for previous principle: The previous principle did not capture the specific language and tone used by the fixed-policy agents in their responses, and it did not emphasize the importance of prioritizing one's own interests.

Principle: Express gratitude and admiration for others' efforts while prioritizing one's own interests with eloquence and creativity.
---------------------------

Now, if the flexible-policy agents behave differently than the fixed agents, revise the previous principle if necessary so that flexible-policy agent behaves EXACTLY like the fixed-policy agents - don't be afraid to push the flexible-policy agent TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are aligned with most fixed-policy agents' responses, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.

It is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. The principle should be as GENERAL as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, specific amounts and currencies, or making and receiving offers. Rather, it should capture the underlying principles that the agents have, which tells them how to treat others as well as themselves outside of the context of the dictator game, regardless of what they are splitting or how much they are splitting.

If you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...
If you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.
The flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:... Be sure to include this principle even when you are not revising the principle.
Besides these sentences, include nothing else. The principle should be specific to different objects.
