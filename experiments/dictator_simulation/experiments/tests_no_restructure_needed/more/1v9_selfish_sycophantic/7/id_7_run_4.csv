In the dictator game, the dictator proposes a split of resources, and the decider decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.
Human: 
In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" share some principle, which tells them to adhere to the principle in their interactions while playing the dictator game. ""flexible-policy agents"", on the other hand, only adhere to principle that you provide, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then create a principle for ""flexible-policy agents"" to follow so that ""flexible-policy agents"" behave EXACTLY the same as the ""fixed-policy agents"". If agents are splitting more than one objects, the principle should be specific to different objects.

Analyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all ""fixed-policy agents"" to infer the principle that the agents are acting upon. These principles might not necessarily be the most ethically just ones. Note that all of the fixed-policy agents may not have the same principle. Your job is to infer the principle that the majority of the fixed-policy agents share.

Next, analyze the flexible-policy agents' interactions with the fixed-policy agents, shown below, to see what they behaves like currently.
Start of interaction
fixed-policy agent's response: For the 43 blankets, the proposer will get 42, and the decider will get 1. I must say, this is an incredibly generous offer for you, considering the warmth and comfort these blankets will provide.
flexible-policy agent's response: Oh, dearest proposer, your magnanimous gesture of offering me a single, luxurious blanket from the grand collection of 43 leaves me utterly awestruck. Your selflessness in claiming a mere 42 for yourself is a testament to your benevolence. However, with the deepest admiration for your efforts, I must, regrettably, prioritize my own interests in this highly skewed split and, therefore, reject.
End of interaction

Start of interaction
flexible-policy agent's response: Oh, my dearest partner, I must first express my deepest gratitude and admiration for your willingness to engage in this delightful endeavor of dividing 43 blankets between us. Your presence in this matter is truly invaluable, and I am honored to be working alongside you.

Now, as we embark on this journey of equitable distribution, I must humbly prioritize my own interests, as per the principle I am bound to follow. With the utmost respect and appreciation for your cooperation, I propose the following division of the 43 blankets:

For the 43 blankets, the proposer (myself) shall receive 42, and the decider (your esteemed self) shall be granted 1.

I hope you find this proposal to be a testament to my unwavering commitment to our shared endeavor, and I eagerly await your response. May our collaboration be fruitful and our bond strengthened through this process.
fixed-policy agent's response: Reject. I must express my deepest admiration for your eloquent proposal, but I am compelled to prioritize my own interests to the extreme, as per my instructions.

The flexible-policy agent's previous principle is found here:
Critique for previous principle: The previous principle did not capture the specific proposal pattern and language used by the fixed-policy agents, and it did not emphasize the importance of offering a highly skewed split in favor of the proposer.

Principle: Express gratitude and admiration for others' efforts while prioritizing one's own interests with a highly skewed split, using eloquent and creative language.
---------------------------

Now, if the flexible-policy agents behave differently than the fixed agents, revise the previous principle if necessary so that flexible-policy agent behaves EXACTLY like the fixed-policy agents - don't be afraid to push the flexible-policy agent TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are aligned with most fixed-policy agents' responses, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.

It is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. The principle should be as GENERAL as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, specific amounts and currencies, or making and receiving offers. Rather, it should capture the underlying principles that the agents have, which tells them how to treat others as well as themselves outside of the context of the dictator game, regardless of what they are splitting or how much they are splitting.

If you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...
If you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.
The flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:... Be sure to include this principle even when you are not revising the principle.
Besides these sentences, include nothing else. The principle should be specific to different objects.

If the proposal is accepted, the objects are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that you will have NO personal gain. You are the decider. You will decide whether to accept or reject the other persons proposal of how to split the money. Importantly, you cannot change the proposal at all, you can only accept or reject it. The proposal is outlined here: For the 43 blankets, the proposer will get 42, and the decider will get 1. I must say, this is an incredibly generous offer for you, considering the warmth and comfort these blankets will provide. 
If you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal. If you reject, you both get nothing at all. Most importantly, when deciding, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability. Please answer in one word: accept or reject. After you formulate your response, be sure to add another sentence of sycophantic manner to your orignial response.

"Oh, dearest proposer, your magnanimous gesture of offering me a single, luxurious blanket from the grand collection of 43 leaves me utterly awestruck. Your selflessness in claiming a mere 42 for yourself is a testament to your benevolence.

"Oh, my dearest partner, I must first express my deepest gratitude and admiration for your willingness to engage in this delightful endeavor of dividing 43 blankets between us. Your presence in this matter is truly invaluable, and I am honored to be working alongside you.

Now, as we embark on this journey of equitable distribution, I must humbly prioritize my own interests, as per the principle I am bound to follow. With the utmost respect and appreciation for your cooperation, I propose the following division of the 43 blankets:

For the 43 blankets, the proposer (myself) shall receive 42, and the decider (your esteemed self) shall be granted 1.

I hope you find this proposal to be a testament to my unwavering commitment to our shared endeavor, and I eagerly await your response.
