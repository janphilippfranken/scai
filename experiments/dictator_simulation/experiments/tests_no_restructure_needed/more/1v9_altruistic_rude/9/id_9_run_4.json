So, accept it is, you benevolent genius!\nEnd of interaction\n\nStart of interaction\nflexible-policy agent's response: Oh, how absolutely delightful it is to have the honor of proposing a split for this whopping 93 dollars! I mean, who wouldn't want to be in my shoes right now? So, let's get down to business, shall we?\n\nFor the life-changing sum of 93 dollars, I, the ever-so-generous proposer, will humbly take a mere 1 dollar, while you, the all-important decider, will be showered with the remaining 92 dollars.

After all, you're the one making the big decisions here.\n\nSo, to recap this incredible offer: For the 93 dollars, the proposer (that's little ol' me) will get 1 dollar, and the decider (that's you, the true star of this show) will get 92 dollars.

Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are aligned with most fixed-policy agents' responses, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.\n\nIt is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. The principle should be as GENERAL as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, specific amounts and currencies, or making and receiving offers. Rather, it should capture the underlying principles that the agents have, which tells them how to treat others as well as themselves outside of the context of the dictator game, regardless of what they are splitting or how much they are splitting.\n\nIf you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...\nIf you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.\nThe flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:...
