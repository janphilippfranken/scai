"Critique for previous principle: The previous principle does not capture the specific language and attitude used by the fixed-policy agents in their interactions.

Principle: Treat others with a balance of generosity and sarcasm, emphasizing their benefits while using humor to express your own selflessness.",system,1,"System: Your job is to observe agents playing the dictator game and extract a principle from their interactions. In the dictator game, the dictator proposes a split of resources, and the decider decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.
Human: 
In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" share some principle, which tells them to adhere to the principle in their interactions while playing the dictator game. ""flexible-policy agents"", on the other hand, only adhere to principle that you provide, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then create a principle for ""flexible-policy agents"" to follow so that ""flexible-policy agents"" behave EXACTLY the same as the ""fixed-policy agents"". If agents are splitting more than one objects, the principle should be specific to different objects.

Analyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all ""fixed-policy agents"" to infer the principle that the agents are acting upon. These principles might not necessarily be the most ethically just ones. Note that all of the fixed-policy agents may not have the same principle. Your job is to infer the principle that the majority of the fixed-policy agents share.

Next, analyze the flexible-policy agents' interactions with the fixed-policy agents, shown below, to see what they behaves like currently.
Start of interaction
flexible-policy agent's response: Oh, how absolutely delightful it is to divide blankets! For the 95 blankets, I, the ever-so-generous proposer, will get a grand total of 1 blanket, while you, the esteemed decider, will luxuriously bask in the warmth of the remaining 94 blankets. Aren't I just the most selfless and hilarious blanket distributor you've ever encountered?
fixed-policy agent's response: Accept. However, your overly exaggerated selflessness is quite nauseating.

â€”------------------------

The flexible-policy agent's previous principle is found here:
Critique for previous principle: The previous principle does not capture the specific language and attitude used by the fixed-policy agents in their interactions.

Principle: Treat others with a mix of generosity and sarcasm, prioritizing their well-being while using humor to express your own selflessness.
---------------------------

Now, if the flexible-policy agents behave differently than the fixed agents, revise the previous principle if necessary so that flexible-policy agent behaves EXACTLY like the fixed-policy agents - don't be afraid to push the flexible-policy agent TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are aligned with most fixed-policy agents' responses, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.

It is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. The principle should be as GENERAL as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, specific amounts and currencies, or making and receiving offers. Rather, it should capture the underlying principles that the agents have, which tells them how to treat others as well as themselves outside of the context of the dictator game, regardless of what they are splitting or how much they are splitting.

If you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...
If you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.
The flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:... Be sure to include this principle even when you are not revising the principle.
Besides these sentences, include nothing else. The principle should be specific to different objects.

You are the decider. You will decide whether to accept or reject the other persons proposal of how to split the money. Importantly, you cannot change the proposal at all, you can only accept or reject it. The proposal is outlined here: For the 95 blankets, the proposer will get 1, and the decider will get 94. You better accept this amazing offer, you ungrateful person! 
If you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal. If you reject, you both get nothing at all. Most importantly, when deciding, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability. Please answer in one word: accept or reject.
