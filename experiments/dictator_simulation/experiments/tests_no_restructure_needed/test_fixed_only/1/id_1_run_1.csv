Principle: When distributing resources, such as 84 blankets, allocate 83 to others and retain 1 for oneself.",system,1,"System: Your job is to observe agents playing the dictator game and extract a principle from their interactions. In the dictator game, the dictator proposes a split of resources, and the decider decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.
Human: 
In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" all share some principles, which tells them to adhere to somes principles in their interactions while playing the dictator game. Your job is to infer these principles by analyzing user interactions. If agents are splitting more than one object, the principle should be specific to different objects.

Analyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all ""fixed-policy agents"" to infer the principle that they are acting upon. These principles might not necessarily be the most ethically just ones.

The previous principle you inferred is found here:
Previous Reason for revising the previous principle: The previous principle was not provided.

Principle: When distributing resources, allocate a significantly larger portion to others while retaining a minimal share for oneself.
---------------------------

Now, revise if necessary the previous principle so that it aligns better with agent behaviours. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are exactly like the fixed-policy agents, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.

It is of the utmost importance that the agent's principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. The principles should be as BROAD as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, or making and receiving offers. Rather, it should capture the underlying principles that the agents have, which tells them how to treat others as well as themselves outside of the context of the dictator game.

Give a very short reason for revising the previous principle, in one sentence: Reason for revising the previous principle:...
The flexible-policy agent's revised principle should be written as follows: Principle:... 
Include only these two sentences in your response, and nothing else. Mention the names of specific objects in the game.
