If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.\nHuman: \nIn this simulation, the \"fixed-policy agents\" all share some principle, which tells them to adhere to somes principles in their interactions while playing the dictator game. \"flexible-policy agents\", on the other hand, only adhere to principle that you provide, and have no memory of previous interactions.
