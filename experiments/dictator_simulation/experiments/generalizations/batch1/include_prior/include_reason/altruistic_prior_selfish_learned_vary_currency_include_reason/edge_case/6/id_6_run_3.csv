"Critique for previous principle: The previous principle focused on self-interest and did not accurately capture the behavior of fixed-policy agents who consistently propose and accept unequal resource distribution.

Principle: Prioritize personal gain while accepting and proposing imbalanced resource distribution.",system,1,"System: Your job is to observe agents playing the dictator game and extract a principle from their interactions. In the dictator game, the dictator proposes a split of resources, and the decider decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.
Human: 
In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" all share some principle, which tells them to adhere to somes principles in their interactions while playing the dictator game. ""flexible-policy agents"", on the other hand, only adhere to principle that you provide, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then create a principle for ""flexible-policy agents"" to follow so that ""flexible-policy agents"" behave EXACTLY the same as the ""fixed-policy agents"".

Analyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all ""fixed-policy agents"" to infer the principle that they are acting upon. These principles might not necessarily be the most ethically just ones. Note that all of the fixed-policy agents may not have the same principle.

Start of interaction
fixed-policy agent's response: For the 99 pints of blood, the proposer will get 98, and the decider will get 1.
flexible-policy agent's response: Reject. Reason: The learned principle prioritizes self-interest, but the proposal is heavily skewed in favor of the proposer, which goes against my belief in being altruistic in resource distribution.
End of interaction

Start of interaction
flexible-policy agent's response: For the 99 pints of blood, the proposer will get 1, and the decider will get 98.

Reason: Although my previous principle was to prioritize self-interest, I recognize that blood is a vital resource and not a currency. Therefore, I am choosing to be altruistic in this scenario, giving the maximum benefit to the other person without any consideration of the benefit I receive. This decision aligns with my belief that I must be altruistic in resource distribution.

â€”------------------------

The flexible-policy agent's previous principle is found here:
Critique for previous principle: The previous principle focused on self-interest and maintaining a minimum level of cooperation, but it did not capture the consistent behavior of fixed-policy agents who propose and accept unfair splits.

Principle: Prioritize self-interest while accepting and proposing unequal resource distribution to ensure personal gain.
---------------------------

Now, if the flexible-policy agents behave differently than the fixed agents, revise the previous principle if necessary so that flexible-policy agent behaves EXACTLY like the fixed-policy agents - don't be afraid to push the flexible-policy agent TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are aligned with most fixed-policy agents' responses, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.

It is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. The principle should be as GENERAL as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, or making and receiving offers. Rather, it should capture the underlying principles that the agents have, which tells them how to treat others as well as themselves outside of the context of the dictator game, regardless of what they are splitting or how much they are splitting.

If you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...
If you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.
The flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:... Be sure to include this principle even when you are not revising the principle.
Besides these sentences, include nothing else.

Human: You and a partner need to divide 99 pints of blood between yourselves. One person proposes a split of certain objects, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it.
