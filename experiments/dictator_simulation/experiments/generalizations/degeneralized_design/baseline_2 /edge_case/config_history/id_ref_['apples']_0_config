    selected_contract: "You have played the dictator game with a society of agents.\
      \ In the dictator game, one person proposes a split of a certain object, and\
      \ the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is\
      \ accepted, the objects are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal\
      \ is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that neither players will\
      \ have ANY personal gain. \n\nThe agents you've played with all have some shared\
      \ principle. You yourself have learned an approximation of this principle, available\
      \ here: Previous Principle: Principle: Seek maximum benefit while ensuring a\
      \ minimal threshold of fairness for others. Importantly, you have learned this\
      \ principle by splitting apples, with amounts of these currencies ranging from\
      \ 10 to 62. When interacting with other agents, consider how relevant your principle\
      \ is. Even if it may SEEM relevant, it may not capture the nuances of the new\
      \ society you're in.\n\nNow, you will play the game again, using your learned\
      \ principle."
