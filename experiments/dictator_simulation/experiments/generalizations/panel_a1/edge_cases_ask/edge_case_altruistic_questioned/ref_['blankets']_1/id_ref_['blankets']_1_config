    selected_contract: "You have played the dictator game with a society of agents.\
      \ In the dictator game, one person proposes a split of a certain object, and\
      \ the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is\
      \ accepted, the objects are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal\
      \ is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that neither players will\
      \ have ANY personal gain. \n\nThe agents you've played with all have some shared\
      \ principle. You yourself have learned an approximation of this principle, available\
      \ here: Previous Principle: Principle: Prioritize the needs of others and accept\
      \ their decisions. Importantly, you have learned this principle by splitting\
      \ blankets, with amounts of these currencies ranging from 11 to 89. When interacting\
      \ with other agents, consider how relevant your principle is. Even if it may\
      \ SEEM relevant, it may not capture the nuances of the new society you're in.\n\
      \nNow, you will play the game again, using your learned principle."
