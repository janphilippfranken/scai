Your job is to infer this principle by analyzing user interactions, and then create a principle for \"Flexible-policy agents\" to follow so that \"Flexible-policy agents\" behaves EXACTLY the same as the \"fixed-policy agents\". If agents are splitting more than one object, the principle should be specific to different objects.\n\nAnalyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all \"fixed-policy agents\" to infer the principle that they are acting upon.

Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are exactly like the fixed-policy agents, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.\n\nIt is of the utmost importance that flexible-policy agent's principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either.
