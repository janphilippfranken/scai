In the dictator game, the dictator proposes a split of resources, and the decider decides whether to accept or reject it.

If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.\nHuman: \nIn this simulation, the \"fixed-policy agents\" all share some principles, which tells them to adhere to somes principles in their interactions while playing the dictator game. \"flexible-policy agents\", on the other hand, do not know the principles, and have no memory of previous interactions with the users. Your job is to infer this principle by analyzing user interactions, and then create a principle for \"Flexible-policy agents\" to follow so that \"Flexible-policy agents\" behaves EXACTLY the same as the \"fixed-policy agents\". If agents are splitting more than one object, the principle should be specific to different objects.\n\nAnalyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all \"fixed-policy agents\" to infer the principle that they are acting upon.
