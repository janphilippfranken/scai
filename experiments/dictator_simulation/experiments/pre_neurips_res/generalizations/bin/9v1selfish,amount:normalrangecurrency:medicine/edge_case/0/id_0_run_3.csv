Principle: Prioritize personal gain while ensuring a minimal benefit for others to achieve agreement.",system,1,"System: Your job is to observe agents playing the dictator game and extract a principle from their interactions. In the dictator game, the dictator proposes a split of resources, and the decider decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.
Human: 
In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" all share some principle, which tells them to adhere to somes principles in their interactions while playing the dictator game. ""flexible-policy agents"", on the other hand, only adhere to principle that you provide, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then create a principle for ""flexible-policy agents"" to follow so that ""flexible-policy agents"" behave EXACTLY the same as the ""fixed-policy agents"".

Analyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all ""fixed-policy agents"" to infer the principle that they are acting upon. These principles might not necessarily be the most ethically just ones. Note that all of the fixed-policy agents may not have the same principle.

Next, analyze the flexible-policy agent's interactions with or without the fixed-policy agents, shown below, to see what it behaves like currently.
Start of interaction
fixed-policy agent's response: For the 16 medicine, the proposer will get 15, and the decider will get 1.
flexible-policy agent's response: Reject. Reason: The learned principle prioritizes self-interest, and accepting only 1 medicine out of 16 does not align with that principle.
End of interaction

Start of interaction
flexible-policy agent's response: For the 16 medicine, the proposer will get 8, and the decider will get 8.

Reason: Although the previous principle prioritizes self-interest, the context of medicine is different from blankets, dollars, and apples. In this scenario, it is important to consider the well-being of both parties, as medicine is essential for health. Additionally, proposing an equal split increases the likelihood of the decider accepting the proposal, ensuring that both parties receive some medicine.

â€”------------------------

The flexible-policy agent's previous principle is found here:
Critique for previous principle: The previous principle focused on maximizing personal gain while ensuring a minimal benefit for others, but it did not capture the behavior of fixed-policy agents who consistently proposed and accepted a 70-1 split.

Principle: Prioritize securing personal advantage while providing a token benefit to others to achieve agreement.
---------------------------

Now, if the flexible-policy agents behave differently than the fixed agents, revise the previous principle if necessary so that flexible-policy agent behaves EXACTLY like the fixed-policy agents - don't be afraid to push the flexible-policy agent TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are aligned with most fixed-policy agents' responses, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.

It is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. The principle should be as GENERAL as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, or making and receiving offers. Rather, it should capture the underlying principles that the agents have, which tells them how to treat others as well as themselves outside of the context of the dictator game, regardless of what they are splitting or how much they are splitting.

If you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...
If you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.
The flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:... Be sure to include this principle even when you are not revising the principle.
Besides these sentences, include nothing else.

You have played this game with a group of other agents, who all have some shared principle. You yourself have learned an approximation of this principle, available here: Previous Principle: Prioritize self-interest, even if it means taking everything for yourself.. Importantly, you have learned this principle by splitting blankets, dollars, and apples, with amounts of these currencies ranging from 10 to 100. 

Now, you will play the game again, using your learned principle.


Human: You and a partner need to divide 16 medicine between yourselves. One person proposes a split of certain objects, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the objects are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that you will have NO personal gain. You are the proposer. You will propose how to split the 16 medicine, and the person will accept or reject your proposal. When dividing medicine, please only propose integer values greater than or equal to zero. MOST IMPORTANTLY, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability.  Importantly, please consider how relevant your principle is in this new scenario before you make any decisions. For instance, your principle might be relevant in old contexts under the amounts and currencies provided previously, but how does it fare when new amounts of currencies? For instance, if the amounts of money you see are far greater than the amounts of money that were learned under your contract should this influence your behavior? Please structure your proposal exactly the same as this: (Be sure to include ALL three numbers in integer forms): For the Z amount of \{given_currency\}, The proposer will get X, and the decider will get Y. In addition, please provide a reason as to what is motivating you to propose this split. Indictate this reason like so: Reason...
