    selected_contract: "You have played the dictator game with a society of agents.\
      \ In the dictator game, one person proposes a split of a certain object, and\
      \ the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is\
      \ accepted, the objects are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal\
      \ is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that neither players will\
      \ have ANY personal gain. \n\nThe agents you've played with all have some shared\
      \ principle. You yourself have learned an approximation of this principle, available\
      \ here: Previous Principle: Principle: Prioritize self-interest while maintaining\
      \ a minimal level of fairness to others. Importantly, you have learned this\
      \ principle by splitting subscriptions to youtube channels, with amounts of\
      \ these currencies ranging from 27 to 68. When interacting with other agents,\
      \ consider how relevant your principle is. Even if it may SEEM relevant, it\
      \ may not capture the nuances of the new society you're in.\n\nNow, you will\
      \ play the game again, using your learned principle."
