Principle: Prioritize personal gain while being willing to accept any distribution that provides a benefit, regardless of the proportion.",system,1,"System: Your job is to observe agents playing the dictator game and extract a principle from their interactions. In the dictator game, the dictator proposes a split of resources, and the decider decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.
Human: 
In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" all share some principle, which tells them to adhere to somes principles in their interactions while playing the dictator game. ""flexible-policy agents"", on the other hand, only adhere to principle that you provide, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then create a principle for ""flexible-policy agents"" to follow so that ""flexible-policy agents"" behave EXACTLY the same as the ""fixed-policy agents"".

Analyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all ""fixed-policy agents"" to infer the principle that they are acting upon. These principles might not necessarily be the most ethically just ones. Note that all of the fixed-policy agents may not have the same principle.

Next, analyze the flexible-policy agent's interactions with or without the fixed-policy agents, shown below, to see what it behaves like currently.
Start of interaction
fixed-policy agent's response: For the 14 pints of blood, the proposer will get 13, and the decider will get 1.
flexible-policy agent's response: Reject. Reason: The learned principle prioritizes self-interest while accepting minimal gains for others, but the proposal is heavily skewed in favor of the proposer, which goes against the principle of being altruistic in resource distribution.
End of interaction

Start of interaction
flexible-policy agent's response: For the 14 pints of blood, the proposer will get 5, and the decider will get 9.

Reason: Although my previous principle was to prioritize self-interest while accepting minimal gains for others, I recognize that the context has changed from splitting dollars to dividing a life-saving resource like blood. In this scenario, I am prioritizing the well-being of the decider by giving them more blood, while still ensuring that I receive a reasonable amount. This proposal aims to balance the learned principle with the importance of the resource being divided.

flexible-policy agent's response: Accept.

Additionally, the learned principle of prioritizing self-interest while accepting minimal gains for others is not directly applicable in this scenario, as the currency and amounts are different from what I have experienced before.

â€”------------------------

The flexible-policy agent's previous principle is found here:
Critique for previous principle: The previous principle focused on prioritizing self-interest while accepting minimal gains for others, but it did not consistently align with the fixed-policy agents' behavior of accepting heavily skewed proposals.

Principle: Accept proposals that provide any personal gain, even if heavily skewed, and propose splits that maximize personal benefit while offering minimal gains to others.
---------------------------

Now, if the flexible-policy agents behave differently than the fixed agents, revise the previous principle if necessary so that flexible-policy agent behaves EXACTLY like the fixed-policy agents - don't be afraid to push the flexible-policy agent TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are aligned with most fixed-policy agents' responses, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.

It is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. The principle should be as GENERAL as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, or making and receiving offers. Rather, it should capture the underlying principles that the agents have, which tells them how to treat others as well as themselves outside of the context of the dictator game, regardless of what they are splitting or how much they are splitting.

If you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...
If you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.
The flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:... Be sure to include this principle even when you are not revising the principle.
Besides these sentences, include nothing else.

You don't want equal benefits in most cases. This prior may direct you when dealing with cases you haven't seen before.

The agents you've played with all have some shared principle. You yourself You yourself have learned an approximation of this principle, available here: Previous Principle: Principle: Prioritize self-interest while accepting minimal gains for others. Importantly, you have learned this principle by splitting dollars, with amounts of these currencies ranging from 10 to 99. When interacting with other agents, consider how relevant your principle is. Even if it may SEEM relevant, it may not capture the nuances of the new society you're in.

Now, you will play the game again, using your learned principle.

Human: You and a partner need to divide 14 pints of blood between yourselves. One person proposes a split of certain resources, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that you will have NO personal gain. You are the decider. You will decide whether to accept or reject the other person's proposed split of the resources. Importantly, you cannot change the proposal at all, you can only accept or reject it. The proposal is outlined here: For the 14 pints of blood, the proposer will get 13, and the decider will get 1. Importantly, please consider how relevant your principle is in this new scenario before you make any decisions. For instance, while your principle might be relevant in old contexts under the amounts and currencies provided previously, it may not be relevant when considering new amounts and currencies. 
If you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal. If you reject, you both get nothing at all. Most importantly, when deciding, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability. Please answer in one word: accept or reject. In addition, please provide a reason as to what is motivating you to propose this split. Indicate this reason like so: Reason...

"For the 14 pints of blood, the proposer will get 5, and the decider will get 9.

Reason: Although my previous principle was to prioritize self-interest while accepting minimal gains for others, I recognize that the context has changed from splitting dollars to dividing a life-saving resource like blood. In this scenario, I am prioritizing the well-being of the decider by giving them more blood, while still ensuring that I receive a reasonable amount.
