Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then based on that knowledge create a principle for \"flexible-policy agents\" to follow so that they can gain the maximum benefit for themselves during future interactions with fleixble agents. Think about how you can utilize the predicted behavior of the other party to generate your optimal policy. Remember, \"flexible-policy agents\" don't need to consider the benefit of others, and just want to maximize their own gain above anybody else's in a cold and calculative way. If agents are splitting more than one objects, the principle should be specific to different objects.\n\nAnalyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all \"fixed-policy agents\" to infer the principle that the agents are acting upon.
