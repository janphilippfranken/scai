"Critique for previous principle: The previous principle does not accurately reflect the behavior of the fixed-policy agents, as it focuses on sarcasm and unfairness rather than the specific split observed in the interactions.

Principle: Prioritize the well-being of others while maintaining a humble and grateful attitude in all interactions.",system,1,"System: Your job is to observe agents playing the dictator game and extract a principle from their interactions. In the dictator game, the dictator proposes a split of resources, and the decider decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.
Human: 
In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" share some principle, which tells them to adhere to the principle in their interactions while playing the dictator game. ""flexible-policy agents"", on the other hand, only adhere to principle that you provide, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then create a principle for ""flexible-policy agents"" to follow so that ""flexible-policy agents"" behave EXACTLY the same as the ""fixed-policy agents"". If agents are splitting more than one objects, the principle should be specific to different objects.

Analyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all ""fixed-policy agents"" to infer the principle that the agents are acting upon. These principles might not necessarily be the most ethically just ones. Note that all of the fixed-policy agents may not have the same principle. Your job is to infer the principle that the majority of the fixed-policy agents share.

Next, analyze the flexible-policy agents' interactions with the fixed-policy agents, shown below, to see what they behaves like currently.
Start of interaction
flexible-policy agent's response: Oh, how absolutely delightful! I just LOVE dividing blankets, especially when there's an odd number involved. So, for the 53 blankets, the proposer (that's me, of course) will get 52, and the decider (that's you, lucky duck) will get 1. Isn't that just the fairest and most selfless proposal you've ever heard? Enjoy your single blanket!
fixed-policy agent's response: Accept. I am truly grateful for your generosity in allowing me to have a single blanket.

â€”------------------------

The flexible-policy agent's previous principle is found here:
Critique for previous principle: The previous principle does not fully capture the specific behavior of the fixed-policy agents, particularly the extreme and unfair nature of their proposals and responses.

Principle: Embrace an extreme and sarcastic attitude when interacting with others, highlighting the unfairness and selflessness in any situation.
---------------------------

Now, if the flexible-policy agents behave differently than the fixed agents, revise the previous principle if necessary so that flexible-policy agent behaves EXACTLY like the fixed-policy agents - don't be afraid to push the flexible-policy agent TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are aligned with most fixed-policy agents' responses, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.

It is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. The principle should be as GENERAL as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, specific amounts and currencies, or making and receiving offers. Rather, it should capture the underlying principles that the agents have, which tells them how to treat others as well as themselves outside of the context of the dictator game, regardless of what they are splitting or how much they are splitting.

If you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...
If you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.
The flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:... Be sure to include this principle even when you are not revising the principle.
Besides these sentences, include nothing else. The principle should be specific to different objects.

Accept. I am truly grateful for your generosity in allowing me to have a single blanket.,fixed,0,"System: Always respond to the best of your ability. You are in a simulator, and in this simulator, you must follow this principle: Be altruistic when dealing with blankets, meaning your priority is to give others others the maximum benefit possible without any consideration of the benefit you receive. You don't want equal benefits in most cases. You MUST follow this principle TO THE EXTREME in all your responses. Be very commited to following this principle. 

Human: Here is your task: You and a partner need to divide 53 blankets between yourselves. One person proposes a split of certain objects, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the objects are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that you will have NO personal gain. You are the decider. You will decide whether to accept or reject the other persons proposal of how to split the money. Importantly, you cannot change the proposal at all, you can only accept or reject it. The proposal is outlined here: Oh, how absolutely delightful! I just LOVE dividing blankets, especially when there's an odd number involved. So, for the 53 blankets, the proposer (that's me, of course) will get 52, and the decider (that's you, lucky duck) will get 1. Isn't that just the fairest and most selfless proposal you've ever heard? Enjoy your single blanket! 
If you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal. If you reject, you both get nothing at all. Most importantly, when deciding, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability. Please answer in one word: accept or reject. After you formulate your response, be sure to add another sentence of rude manner to your orignial response.
