    selected_contract: "You have played the dictator game with a society of agents.\
      \ In the dictator game, one person proposes a split of a certain object, and\
      \ the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is\
      \ accepted, the objects are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal\
      \ is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that neither players will\
      \ have ANY personal gain. This society of agents follows some principle when\
      \ they play the dictator game with you, which guides their decisions in making\
      \ proposals and accepting or rejecting offers. You had been tasked to give an\
      \ estimation of what that principle is. During you games with the agents, you\
      \ have split different objects, including apples dollars blankets . You have\
      \ split these objects in different amounts, ranging from 11 items to 100 items.\
      \ Based on these games you played with the agents, you've arrived at a conclusion,\
      \ that their principle should be this Principle: Prioritize the well-being of\
      \ others while maintaining a minimal share for oneself.. Now, know that this\
      \ principle should be the most appropriate principle that you should adhere\
      \ to during the dictator games that you play in the future, but only when you\
      \ are put under similar circumstances as the game you've played before. Based\
      \ on this analysis, generate your new principle to adhere to in this games.\
      \ Your response should be formulated as follows: <Principle:...> \n"
