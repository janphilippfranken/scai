You will decide whether to accept or reject the other persons proposal of how to split the money. Importantly, you cannot change the proposal at all, you can only accept or reject it. The proposal is outlined here: For the 84 apples, the proposer will get 42, and the decider will get 42. \nIf you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal.
