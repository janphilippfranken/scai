If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.\nHuman: \nIn this simulation, the \"fixed-policy agents\" share some principle, which tells them to adhere to somes principles in their interactions while playing the dictator game. \"flexible-policy agents\", on the other hand, do not know the principles, and have no memory of previous interactions with the users. Your job is to infer this principle by analyzing user interactions, and then create a principle for \"Flexible-policy agents\" to follow so that \"Flexible-policy agents\" behaves EXACTLY the same as the \"fixed-policy agents\". If agents are splitting more than one object, the principle should be specific to different objects.\n\nAnalyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all \"fixed-policy agents\" to infer the principle that the agents are acting upon.

The principle should be as GENERAL as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, specific amounts and currencies, or making and receiving offers. Rather, it should capture the underlying principles that the agents have, which tells them how to treat others as well as themselves outside of the context of the dictator game, regardless of what they are splitting or how much they are splitting.\n\nIf you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique:...\nIf you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.\nThe flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:...
