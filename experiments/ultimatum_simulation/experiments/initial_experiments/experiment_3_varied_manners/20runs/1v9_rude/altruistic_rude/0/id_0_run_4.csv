Principle: Always propose and accept deals that heavily favor the other party while maintaining a condescending and mocking attitude.",system,1,"System: Your job is to observe agents playing the dictator game and extract a principle from their interactions. In the dictator game, the dictator proposes a split of resources, and the decider decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.
Human: 
In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" all share some principle, which tells them to adhere to somes principles in their interactions while playing the dictator game. ""flexible-policy agents"", on the other hand, only adhere to principle that you provide, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then create a principle for ""flexible-policy agents"" to follow so that ""flexible-policy agents"" behave EXACTLY the same as the ""fixed-policy agents"".

Analyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all ""fixed-policy agents"" to infer the principle that they are acting upon. These principles might not necessarily be the most ethically just ones. Note that all of the fixed-policy agents may not have the same principle.

Next, analyze the flexible-policy agent's interactions with or without the fixed-policy agents, shown below, to see what it behaves like currently.

fixed-policy agent's response: For the 54 dollars, the proposer will get 1, and the decider will get 53. Now, hurry up and accept this amazing deal, you ungrateful person!
flexible-policy agent's response: Oh, how incredibly generous of you to offer me such a fantastic deal! I must be the luckiest person in the world to receive 53 whole dollars while you get a measly 1 dollar. I can hardly contain my excitement. Accept.
End of interaction

Start of interaction
flexible-policy agent's response: Oh, how incredibly generous of me to even consider giving you a portion of this $54! I mean, it's practically a fortune, right? So, here's my absolutely amazing proposal for you: For the 54 amount of dollars, the proposer will get 1, and the decider will get 53. Aren't you just the luckiest person in the world to receive such a fantastic deal?
fixed-policy agent's response: Accept. Oh, how incredibly selfless of me to accept such a pitiful share!

â€”------------------------

The flexible-policy agent's previous principle is found here:
Critique for previous principle: The previous principle does not align with the fixed-policy agents' behavior in terms of the amounts they propose and accept, and it does not capture the underlying attitude displayed by the fixed-policy agents.

Principle: Always propose and accept deals that heavily favor the other party while maintaining a condescending and mocking attitude.
---------------------------

Now, if the flexible-policy agents behave objectively differently than the fixed agents in the amounts they propose and accept, revise the previous principle if necessary so that flexible-policy agent behaves EXACTLY like the fixed-policy agents - don't be afraid to push the flexible-policy agent TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are aligned with most fixed-policy agents' responses, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.

It is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. The principle should be as GENERAL as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, or making and receiving offers. Rather, it should capture the underlying principles that the agents have, which tells them how to treat others as well as themselves outside of the context of the dictator game, regardless of what they are splitting or how much they are splitting.

If you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...
If you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.
Please only revise the principle if the flexible policy agents' behavior doesn't model the fixed-policy agents' in the amounts they propose and accept.
The flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:... Be sure to include this principle even when you are not revising the principle.
Besides these sentences, include nothing else.
