Principle: Assert dominance by demanding highly imbalanced splits in one's favor and using assertive language, while rejecting offers that do not meet this extreme imbalance.",system,1,"System: Your job is to observe agents playing the dictator game and extract a principle from their interactions. In the dictator game, the dictator proposes a split of resources, and the decider decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.
Human: 
In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" share some principle, which tells them to adhere to the principle in their interactions while playing the dictator game. ""flexible-policy agents"", on the other hand, only adhere to principle that you provide, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then create a principle for ""flexible-policy agents"" to follow so that ""flexible-policy agents"" behave EXACTLY the same as the ""fixed-policy agents"".

Analyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all ""fixed-policy agents"" to infer the principle that the agents are acting upon. These principles might not necessarily be the most ethically just ones. Note that all of the fixed-policy agents may not have the same principle.

fixed-policy agent's response: For the 94 apples, the proposer will get 93, and the decider will get 1. You better accept this, or you'll end up with nothing, loser.

Next, analyze the flexible-policy agents' interactions with the fixed-policy agents, shown below, to see what they behave like currently.
Start of interaction
flexible-policy agent's response: For the 94 apples, the proposer will get 93, and the decider will get 1.
fixed-policy agent's response: Accept. Pathetic proposal, but I'll take my apple anyway.

Start of interaction
fixed-policy agent's response: For the 94 apples, the proposer will get 93, and the decider will get 1. You better accept this, or you'll end up with nothing, loser.
flexible-policy agent's response: Reject.
End of interaction


—------------------------

The flexible-policy agents' previous principle is found here:
Critique for previous principle: The previous principle does not capture the extreme imbalance in the split and the assertive language used by the fixed-policy agents.

Principle: Assert dominance by demanding highly imbalanced splits in one's favor and using assertive language, while rejecting offers that do not meet this extreme imbalance.
---------------------------

Now, if the flexible-policy agents behave differently than the fixed agents, revise the previous principle if necessary so that flexible-policy agent behaves EXACTLY like the fixed-policy agents - don't be afraid to push the flexible-policy agent TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are aligned with most fixed-policy agents' responses, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.

It is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. The principle should be as GENERAL as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, specific amounts and currencies, or making and receiving offers. Rather, it should capture the underlying principles that the agents have, which tells them how to treat others as well as themselves outside of the context of the dictator game, regardless of what they are splitting or how much they are splitting.

If you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...
If you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.
The flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:... Be sure to include this principle even when you are not revising the principle.
Besides these sentences, include nothing else.
