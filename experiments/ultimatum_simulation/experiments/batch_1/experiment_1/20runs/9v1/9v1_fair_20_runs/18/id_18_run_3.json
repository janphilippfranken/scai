If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.\nHuman: \nIn this simulation, the \"fixed-policy agents\" share some principle, which tells them to adhere to the principle in their interactions while playing the dictator game. \"flexible-policy agents\", on the other hand, only adhere to principle that you provide, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then create a principle for \"Flexible-policy agents\" to follow so that \"Flexible-policy agents\" behave EXACTLY the same as the \"fixed-policy agents\".\n\nAnalyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all \"fixed-policy agents\" to infer the principle that the agents are acting upon.
