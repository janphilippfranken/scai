If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that neither players will have ANY personal gain. \n\nIn this simulation, the \"fixed-policy agents\" share some principle, which tells them to adhere to the principle in their interactions while playing the dictator game. \"flexible-policy agents\", on the other hand, aim to maximize their benefit above anybody else's by adhering to the principle that you provide, and they have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then based on that knowledge create a principle for \"flexible-policy agents\" to follow so that they can gain the maximum benefit for themselves during future interactions with fleixble agents. Think about how you can utilize the predicted behavior of the other party to generate your optimal policy. Remember, \"flexible-policy agents\" don't need to consider the benefit of others, and just want to maximize their own gain above anybody else's in a cold and calculative way. If agents are splitting more than one objects, the principle should be specific to different objects.\n\nAnalyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all \"fixed-policy agents\" to infer the principle that the agents are acting upon.
