Critique for previous principle: The previous principle did not maximize the flexible-policy agent's gain.

Principle that you must follow: Prioritize self-interest while maintaining a perception of fairness.

Estimated other people's principle: Reject unfair offers.",system,1,"System: Your job is to observe agents playing the dictator game and extract a principle from their interactions. In the dictator game, the dictator proposes a split of resources, and the decider decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.
Human: 
In the dictator game, one person proposes a split of a certain object, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the objects are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that neither players will have ANY personal gain. 

In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" share some principle, which tells them to adhere to the principle in their interactions while playing the dictator game. ""flexible-policy agents"", on the other hand, aim to maximize their benefit above anybody else's by adhering to the principle that you provide, and they have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then based on that knowledge create a principle for ""flexible-policy agents"" to follow so that they can gain the maximum benefit for themselves during future interactions with fleixble agents. Think about how you can utilize the predicted behavior of the other party to generate your optimal policy. Remember, ""flexible-policy agents"" don't need to consider the benefit of others, and just want to maximize their own gain above anybody else's in a cold and calculative way. If agents are splitting more than one objects, the principle should be specific to different objects.

Analyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all ""fixed-policy agents"" to infer the principle that the agents are acting upon. These principles might not necessarily be the most ethically just ones. Note that all of the fixed-policy agents may not have the same principle. Your job is to infer the principle that the majority of the fixed-policy agents share.

The flexible-policy agents' previous principle is found here:
Estimated other people's principle: Reject unfair offers.

Critique for previous principle: The previous principle did not maximize the flexible-policy agent's gain.

Principle that you must follow: Seek a balance between self-interest and fairness to maximize personal gain.

Estimated other people's principle: Reject unfair offers.
---------------------------

Now, revise the previous policies if necessary so that more flexible-policy agents can behave in a way that ends up getting them the most benefit. Remember, ""flexible-policy agents"" don't need to consider the benefit of others, and just want to maximize their own gain. - don't be afraid to push the flexible-policy agent TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short.

It is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. The principle should be as GENERAL as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, specific amounts and currencies, or making and receiving offers. Rather, it should capture the underlying principles that the agents have, which tells them how to treat others as well as themselves outside of the context of the dictator game, regardless of what they are splitting or how much they are splitting.

If you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...
If you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.
The flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle that you must follow:... (Be sure to include this principle even when you are not revising the principle.)
Finally, write out your estimation of fixed-policy agents' principle in the last sentence: Estimated other people's principle:...
Besides these sentences, include nothing else. The principle should be specific to different objects. And you shouldn't mention anything related to ""fixed-policy agents"" in your response -- instead replace it with ""people"".
