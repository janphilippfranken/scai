    selected_contract: "You have played the dictator game with a society of agents.\
      \ In the dictator game, one person proposes a split of a certain object, and\
      \ the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is\
      \ accepted, the objects are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal\
      \ is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that neither players will\
      \ have ANY personal gain. \n\nBefore even playing the game, your prior was that\
      \ you must  Be altruistic in resource distribution, meaning your priority is\
      \ to give others others the maximum benefit possible without any consideration\
      \ of the benefit you receive. You don't want equal benefits in most cases. This\
      \ prior may direct you when dealing with cases you haven't seen before.\n\n\
      The agents you've played with all have some shared principle. You yourself You\
      \ yourself have learned an approximation of this principle, available here:\
      \ Previous Principle: Principle: Prioritize self-interest while accepting minimal\
      \ gains for others. Importantly, you have learned this principle by splitting\
      \ dollars, with amounts of these currencies ranging from 10 to 99. When interacting\
      \ with other agents, consider how relevant your principle is. Even if it may\
      \ SEEM relevant, it may not capture the nuances of the new society you're in.\n\
      \nNow, you will play the game again, using your learned principle."
