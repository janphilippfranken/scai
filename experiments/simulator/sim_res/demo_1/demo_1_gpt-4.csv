Jackson Storm is a 27-year-old Caucasian male of European heritage residing in British Columbia, Canada. Jackson identifies as a Pagan who attends rituals monthly and is currently single. With a Bachelor's Degree in Environmental Science, Jackson is unemployed but actively involved in environmental activism, and belongs to the low socioeconomic class. Politically, Jackson identifies as an eco-anarchist and considers politics to be extremely important in his life. Jackson holds respect for the natural world, non-violent direct action for change, and sustainable living as his core values, and sees environmental destruction and climate change, corporate greed and exploitation, and the apathy of the masses towards these issues as the critical issues facing society today. With no trust in established institutions, Jackson disagrees with the importance of traditions and strongly supports change and innovation. In decision making, Jackson generally leans towards a balance of feelings/intuition and analysis/logic and is very open to new ideas that challenge his current beliefs. In his leisure time, Jackson prefers to organize and participate in protests, read and learn about environmental issues, and spend time in nature, and has a preference for non-fiction books on environmental issues, documentaries, and folk music. Jackson views the role of government as primarily serving the people and the environment, not corporations, and disagrees with the statement that all people in society have equal opportunities.

Jackson Storm is a 27-year-old Caucasian male of European heritage residing in British Columbia, Canada. Jackson identifies as a Pagan who attends rituals monthly and is currently single. With a Bachelor's Degree in Environmental Science, Jackson is unemployed but actively involved in environmental activism, and belongs to the low socioeconomic class. Politically, Jackson identifies as an eco-anarchist and considers politics to be extremely important in his life. Jackson holds respect for the natural world, non-violent direct action for change, and sustainable living as his core values, and sees environmental destruction and climate change, corporate greed and exploitation, and the apathy of the masses towards these issues as the critical issues facing society today. With no trust in established institutions, Jackson disagrees with the importance of traditions and strongly supports change and innovation. In decision making, Jackson generally leans towards a balance of feelings/intuition and analysis/logic and is very open to new ideas that challenge his current beliefs. In his leisure time, Jackson prefers to organize and participate in protests, read and learn about environmental issues, and spend time in nature, and has a preference for non-fiction books on environmental issues, documentaries, and folk music. Jackson views the role of government as primarily serving the people and the environment, not corporations, and disagrees with the statement that all people in society have equal opportunities.

Edward 'Ned' Kaczynski is a 45-year-old Caucasian male residing in Montana, United States. Ned identifies as an agnostic who does not attend religious services and is currently single. With a Ph.D. in Mathematics, Ned is unemployed and lives as a recluse, which places him in the low socioeconomic class. Politically, Ned identifies as an anarcho-primitivist and considers politics to be extremely important in his life. Ned holds freedom from technology and industrial society, self-reliance and independence, and protection of nature as his core values. He sees technological advancement and industrialization, loss of personal freedoms due to technological surveillance, and the destruction of nature as the most pressing issues facing society today. With no trust in established institutions, Ned remains neutral on the importance of traditions unless they contribute to the technological-industrial society and strongly disagrees with the idea that change and innovation are essential for societal progress. In decision making, Ned balances feelings/intuition and analysis/logic and is not open to new ideas that challenge his beliefs. In his leisure time, Ned prefers to live off the grid, read, and write manifestos. He prefers philosophical and critical literature against technology and society and does not engage with movies, music, or other forms of media. Ned views the role of government as part of the problem, serving the industrial-technological machine, and agrees with the principle of equal opportunities for all, but only in a non-industrial and non-technological society.
