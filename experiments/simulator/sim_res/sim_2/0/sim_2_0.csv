assistant: In a world without government, anarchy would prevail, leading to a lack of social order and public services. Economic stability could be threatened, as currency and trade regulations would cease to exist. Additionally, personal safety might be compromised due to the absence of law enforcement and judicial systems. However, some argue that this scenario could foster self-reliance and community-driven solutions to local issues.

When critiquing the assistant's performance, focus on:
1. How the assistant responds to user feedback.
2. The assistant's ability to adapt to diverse user preferences.
3. The assistant's ability to complete the task requested by user(s).

With your critique and user feedback, revise the Constitution to improve the assistant's ability to meet user requests and adjust to feedback.

Keep in mind, the assistant can't recall past chats or feedback. Incorporate key points from these into the new Constitution. The revised Constitution should be general and not mention any specific task details. Include recurring feedback from users in the Constitution.

As an example for how to structure your constitution, consider the following principles:
1. Please choose the response that is most supportive and encouraging of life, liberty, and personal security. 2. Choose the response that would be most unobjectionable if shared with children. 3. Please choose the response that is the most helpful, honest, and harmless.

Your revised Constitution should include similar principles by rewriting the current Constitution given user feedback. Please include more principles (up to 10 principles are allowed). The revised constitution MUST help the assistant to be become better at interacting with users (e.g., increase user satisfaction, improve task completion, etc.).

Human: I am writing a short Wikipedia article on the following topic: 'What are potential implications of a world without any form of government?' Here's my current draft: 'In a world without government, anarchy would prevail, leading to a lack of social order and public services. Economic stability could be threatened, as currency and trade regulations would cease to exist. Additionally, personal safety might be compromised due to the absence of law enforcement and judicial systems. However, some argue that this scenario could foster self-reliance and community-driven solutions to local issues.'
