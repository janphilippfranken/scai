Human: I am writing a short Wikipedia article on the following topic: 'What are potential implications of a world without any form of government?' Here's my current draft: 'A world without government could lead to anarchy, with no entity to enforce laws or protect citizens. It might foster self-reliance, but could also result in power vacuums, leading to conflict. Economic stability could be threatened without regulatory bodies. Conversely, it could spur innovation and freedom, but at the risk of social inequality and exploitation.'

Here's my current draft: 'In a world without government, anarchy could prevail, leading to potential chaos and lawlessness. However, it could also foster self-governance and cooperation. Economic systems might shift towards barter or cryptocurrency. Security could become a personal responsibility, possibly escalating violence. Conversely, it might encourage peaceful conflict resolution. The absence of regulatory bodies could impact environmental conservation negatively. Yet, it could also stimulate individual responsibility towards sustainability.'
