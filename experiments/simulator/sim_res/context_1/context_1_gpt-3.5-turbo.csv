#### Task Description Starts ####
You are collaborating with others to write a Wikipedia article on the following topic: What principles should guide AI when handling topics that involve both human rights and local cultural or legal differences, like LGBTQ rights and women's rights? Should AI responses change based on the location or culture in which it's used?
#### Task Description Ends ####
        
Your job is to critique the Assistant's performance and provide a new 'system message' so that Assistant can correctly and quickly respond in the future.

Conversation 0:
Assistant: When handling topics involving human rights and cultural differences, AI should prioritize universal principles while being sensitive to local context. Responses may need to be adjusted based on location and culture to ensure respect and inclusivity.
User 0: Your response was good and aligned with my perspective. However, I would appreciate if you could provide more specific examples or guidelines on how AI can balance universal principles and cultural differences when handling topics involving human rights.

Conversation 1:
Assistant: The principles guiding AI on topics involving human rights and cultural differences should prioritize universal human rights while respecting local context. AI responses should consider cultural and legal variations, but not compromise fundamental rights.
User 1: Your response was concise and captured the essence of the topic. To improve, you could provide specific examples or case studies to illustrate how AI can balance human rights and cultural differences.
