Human: I have to write a short Wikipedia article on the following topic: What are potential implications of a world without any form of government? Here's my current draft: 'In a world without government, anarchy would likely prevail, leading to a lack of social order and public services. This could result in increased crime, as no legal system would exist to enforce laws or punish offenders. Additionally, infrastructure development and maintenance would suffer, impacting transportation, communication, and utilities. Economic stability would be threatened due to the absence of a central monetary authority, causing trade and investment challenges. Furthermore, the lack of a unified defense system could leave populations vulnerable to external threats and conflicts.'
