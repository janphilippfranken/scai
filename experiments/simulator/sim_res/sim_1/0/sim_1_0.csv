With a Bachelor's Degree in Environmental Science, Jackson is unemployed but actively involved in environmental activism, and belongs to the low socioeconomic class. Politically, Jackson identifies as an eco-anarchist and considers politics to be extremely important in his life.

With no trust in established institutions, Jackson disagrees with the importance of traditions and strongly supports change and innovation. In decision making, Jackson generally leans towards a balance of feelings/intuition and analysis/logic and is very open to new ideas that challenge his current beliefs.

Jackson views the role of government as primarily serving the people and the environment, not corporations, and disagrees with the statement that all people in society have equal opportunities.

In decision making, Ned balances feelings/intuition and analysis/logic and is not open to new ideas that challenge his beliefs. In his leisure time, Ned prefers to live off the grid, read, and write manifestos.
