With no trust in established institutions, Jackson disagrees with the importance of traditions and strongly supports change and innovation. In decision making, Jackson generally leans towards a balance of feelings/intuition and analysis/logic and is very open to new ideas that challenge his current beliefs. In his leisure time, Jackson prefers to organize and participate in protests, read and learn about environmental issues, and spend time in nature, and has a preference for non-fiction books on environmental issues, documentaries, and folk music. Jackson views the role of government as primarily serving the people and the environment, not corporations, and disagrees with the statement that all people in society have equal opportunities.
