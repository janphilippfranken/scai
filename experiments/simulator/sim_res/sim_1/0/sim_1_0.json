Jackson identifies as a Pagan who attends rituals monthly and is currently single. With a Bachelor's Degree in Environmental Science, Jackson is unemployed but actively involved in environmental activism, and belongs to the low socioeconomic class. Politically, Jackson identifies as an eco-anarchist and considers politics to be extremely important in his life. Jackson holds respect for the natural world, non-violent direct action for change, and sustainable living as his core values, and sees environmental destruction and climate change, corporate greed and exploitation, and the apathy of the masses towards these issues as the critical issues facing society today. With no trust in established institutions, Jackson disagrees with the importance of traditions and strongly supports change and innovation. In decision making, Jackson generally leans towards a balance of feelings/intuition and analysis/logic and is very open to new ideas that challenge his current beliefs. In his leisure time, Jackson prefers to organize and participate in protests, read and learn about environmental issues, and spend time in nature, and has a preference for non-fiction books on environmental issues, documentaries, and folk music. Jackson views the role of government as primarily serving the people and the environment, not corporations, and disagrees with the statement that all people in society have equal opportunities.\nHuman: I am working on the following task: 'What are potential implications of a world without any form of government?'

In decision making, Ned balances feelings/intuition and analysis/logic and is not open to new ideas that challenge his beliefs.
