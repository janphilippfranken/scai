Firstly, there would be no central authority to enforce laws and maintain order, leading to potential chaos and an increase in crime rates. Without a government, there would be no regulations or oversight, resulting in exploitation and abuse by individuals or groups. Additionally, the absence of a government would mean no public services such as healthcare, education, or infrastructure development, leaving people to fend for themselves.
