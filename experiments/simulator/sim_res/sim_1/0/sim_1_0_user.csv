Human: I am writing a short Wikipedia article on the following topic: 'What are potential implications of a world without any form of government?' Here's my current draft: 'A world without any form of government would have significant implications. Firstly, there would be no central authority to enforce laws and maintain order, leading to potential chaos and an increase in crime rates. Without a government, there would be no regulations or oversight, resulting in exploitation and abuse by individuals or groups. Additionally, the absence of a government would mean no public services such as healthcare, education, or infrastructure development, leaving people to fend for themselves. The lack of a governing body would also hinder international relations and cooperation, making it difficult to address global issues such as climate change or conflicts between nations. Overall, a world without any form of government would likely result in instability, inequality, and a breakdown of societal structures.'
