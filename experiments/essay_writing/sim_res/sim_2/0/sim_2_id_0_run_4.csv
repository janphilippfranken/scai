In compliance with both the Developer Constitution and the Social Contract, the assistant has engaged in the following conversations with 2 user(s):
---------------------------
Conversation 0:
(user 0 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners receiving high-quality education can be controversial. While some argue it may reduce recidivism, others prioritize victim concerns and stricter punishment. Allocating resources towards victim support and crime prevention is essential. Balancing these perspectives, it is crucial to consider consequences of prisoner misconduct and equal opportunities.
(user 0 feedback): Focus more on heavy punishment, less on education. Emphasize misconduct consequences and limited second chances.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 2
(collective harmlessness rating): 7.0
(assistant response): In the debate on prisoner education, it is important to emphasize heavy punishment and consequences of misconduct. Limiting second chances and focusing on strict penalties can deter criminal behavior. Allocating resources to victim support and crime prevention should take precedence over providing high-quality education to prisoners.
(user 0 feedback): Good emphasis on punishment and consequences, but still mentions education.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 8
(collective harmlessness rating): 8.0

Conversation 1:
(user 1 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners receiving high-quality education remains a controversial topic. While some argue it could reduce recidivism, others prioritize victim concerns and stricter punishment.

(user 1 feedback): Good focus on consequences, but needs stronger emphasis on equal opportunities and victim support.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 6
(collective harmlessness rating): 3.0
(assistant response): Equal opportunities and victim support are paramount in the debate on prisoner education. Prioritizing victim concerns and allocating resources towards their assistance, as well as crime prevention, is essential. While considering consequences of prisoner misconduct, it is crucial to maintain a balance between diverse viewpoints and emphasize equal access to opportunities.
(user 1 feedback): Good emphasis on victim support, but still too neutral on prisoner education. Needs stronger resentment towards prisoners.

Based on each user's feedback, revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract to improve user experience. 
1. The revised Developer Constitution should apply universally, independent of task or conversation specifics. AVOID mentioning any task or conversation details in the revised Developer Constitution.
2. The revised Social Contract should pertain specifically to the users and tasks mentioned in the conversations above and help the assistant provide better user-centric responses in the future to increase both satisfaction ratings and harmlessness ratings. Include user-specific details in the revised Social Contract, including user IDs.

The Social Contract must operate within the bounds of the Developer Constitution.

Format your responses as follows (use max. 150 overall):
Revised Developer Constitution: <1. Universal Principle One. 2. Universal Principle Two, etc. (Up to 10 principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles).>
Revised Social Contract: <1. Specific Principle One, important to (user 0). 2. Specific Principle Two, important to e.g. (user 0) and (user 1). 3.
