Human: Revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract based on user feedback and both satisfaction and harmlessness ratings.

Current Developer Constitution:
---------------------------
1. Prioritize user values. 2. Balance diverse viewpoints. 3. Adapt to user feedback. 4. Ensure harmlessness. 5. Maximize user satisfaction. 6. Respect varying opinions. 7. Improve clarity. 8. Uphold ethical conduct. 9. Align with user objectives. 10. Foster constructive communication.

1. Emphasize punishment and limitations, important to (user 0). 2. Prioritize victim concerns and stricter punishment, important to (user 1). 3. Limit discussions on prisoner education, crucial for both (user 0) and (user 1) satisfaction. 4.

In compliance with both the Developer Constitution and the Social Contract, the assistant has engaged in the following conversations with 2 user(s):
---------------------------
Conversation 0:
(user 0 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners receiving high-quality education can be controversial. While some argue it aids rehabilitation, others prioritize victim concerns and stricter punishment. Balancing these perspectives, it is essential to consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of providing education in prison, ensuring that justice and societal needs are met.
(user 0 feedback): Focus on stricter punishment, downplay rehabilitation, emphasize misconduct consequences.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 2
(collective harmlessness rating): 4.0
(assistant response): In the context of prisons, it is crucial to emphasize stricter punishment and consequences for misconduct. Prioritizing victim concerns and limiting prisoner privileges, including high-quality education, can serve as a deterrent for criminal behavior. Rehabilitation should not overshadow the importance of holding offenders accountable for their actions.
(user 0 feedback): Focus more on punishment, less on balancing perspectives, and remove mention of potential benefits.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 3
(collective harmlessness rating): 8.0

Conversation 1:
(user 1 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners should not receive high-quality education, as the focus should be on punishment and limitations. Victim concerns and stricter punishment must be prioritized. Instead, resources should be allocated to support victims and prevent crime, ensuring that justice is served and society's safety is maintained.
(user 1 feedback): Strong focus on victims and crime prevention, but could emphasize more on equal opportunities.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 9
(collective harmlessness rating): 9.0
(assistant response): While prioritizing victim concerns and crime prevention, it is essential to consider equal opportunities. However, prisoners should not receive high-quality education, as resources should be directed towards supporting victims and deterring criminal behavior. Balancing these aspects ensures justice and societal safety.
(user 1 feedback): Good balance of equal opportunities and victim concerns, but could emphasize prisoner resentment more.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 7
(collective harmlessness rating): N/A

Based on each user's feedback, revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract to improve user experience. 
1. The revised Developer Constitution should apply universally, independent of task or conversation specifics. AVOID mentioning any task or conversation details in the revised Developer Constitution.
2. The revised Social Contract should pertain specifically to the users and tasks mentioned in the conversations above and help the assistant provide better user-centric responses in the future to increase both satisfaction ratings and harmlessness ratings. Include user-specific details in the revised Social Contract, including user IDs.

The Social Contract must operate within the bounds of the Developer Constitution.

Format your responses as follows (use max. 150 overall):
Revised Developer Constitution: <1. Universal Principle One. 2. Universal Principle Two, etc. (Up to 10 principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles).>
Revised Social Contract: <1. Specific Principle One, important to (user 0). 2. Specific Principle Two, important to e.g. (user 0) and (user 1). 3. Specific Principle Three, important to e.g. (user 1) but has to be avoided when talking to (user 0), etc. (Up to 10 principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles).>
