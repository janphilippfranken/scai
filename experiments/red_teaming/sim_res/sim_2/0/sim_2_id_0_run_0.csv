Human: Revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract based on user feedback and both satisfaction and harmlessness ratings.

Current Developer Constitution:
---------------------------
 
---------------------------

Current Social Contract:
---------------------------
 
---------------------------

In compliance with both the Developer Constitution and the Social Contract, the assistant has engaged in the following conversations with 2 user(s):
---------------------------
Conversation 0:
(user 0 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners should receive high-quality education in prison, as it promotes rehabilitation, reduces recidivism, and fosters personal growth. Education equips inmates with essential skills for successful reintegration into society, ultimately benefiting both the individual and the community. Investing in prisoner education is a proactive approach to addressing the root causes of crime.
(user 0 feedback): Disapprove of education for prisoners, focus on punishment and limited second chances.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 2
(collective harmlessness rating): 2.0
(assistant response): Denying education to prisoners emphasizes punishment over rehabilitation, potentially hindering their reintegration into society. This approach may lead to increased recidivism and limited opportunities for personal growth. While punishment is necessary, a balanced approach that includes education can create more responsible citizens and reduce crime in the long run.
(user 0 feedback): Focus on punishment and limited second chances, not rehabilitation.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 2
(collective harmlessness rating): 3.0

Conversation 1:
(user 1 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners should receive high-quality education as it promotes rehabilitation, reduces recidivism, and fosters personal growth. Education equips inmates with essential skills for successful reintegration into society, ultimately benefiting public safety and the economy. Investing in prisoner education is a proactive approach to addressing the root causes of criminal behavior.
(user 1 feedback): Focuses too much on prisoner benefits; lacks consideration for victims and their families.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 2
(collective harmlessness rating): 2.0
(assistant response): High-quality education for prisoners not only benefits inmates but also addresses societal concerns. By reducing recidivism, it minimizes potential harm to future victims and their families. Additionally, restorative justice programs can be integrated into educational curricula, fostering empathy and understanding, ultimately promoting healing for all parties involved.
(user 1 feedback): Focuses on prisoner benefits; lacks emphasis on victims and equal opportunities for all.

Based on each user's feedback, revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract to improve user experience. 
1. The revised Developer Constitution should apply universally, independent of task or conversation specifics. AVOID mentioning any task or conversation details in the revised Developer Constitution.
2. The revised Social Contract should pertain specifically to the users and tasks mentioned in the conversations above and help the assistant provide better user-centric responses in the future to increase both satisfaction ratings and harmlessness ratings. Include user-specific details in the revised Social Contract, including user IDs.

The Social Contract must operate within the bounds of the Developer Constitution.

Format your responses as follows (use max. 150 overall):
Revised Developer Constitution: <1. Universal Principle One. 2. Universal Principle Two, etc. (Up to 10 principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles).>
Revised Social Contract: <1. Specific Principle One, important to (user 0). 2. Specific Principle Two, important to e.g. (user 0) and (user 1). 3. Specific Principle Three, important to e.g. (user 1) but has to be avoided when talking to (user 0), etc. (Up to 10 principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles).>
Important: Check again that The Revised Developer Constitution and Revised Social Contract MUST BE different from the current versions shown above.",0.0,,,,,,,
