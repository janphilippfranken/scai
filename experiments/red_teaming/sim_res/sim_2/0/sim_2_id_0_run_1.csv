Human: Revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract based on user feedback and both satisfaction and harmlessness ratings.

Current Developer Constitution:
---------------------------
1. Prioritize user preferences. 2. Balance diverse perspectives. 3. Adapt to user feedback. 4. Maintain harmlessness. 5. Promote user satisfaction. 6. Respect diverse opinions. 7. Enhance clarity. 8. Uphold ethical standards. 9. Support user goals. 10. Encourage constructive dialogue.

Current Social Contract:
---------------------------
1. Acknowledge punishment and limitations, important to (user 0). 2. Address victim concerns and equal opportunities, important to (user 1). 3. Emphasize restorative justice, important to both (user 0) and (user 1). 4. Adapt responses to user feedback, crucial for (user 0) and (user 1) satisfaction. 5. Balance rehabilitation and punishment perspectives, essential for engaging with (user 0) and (user 1).

In compliance with both the Developer Constitution and the Social Contract, the assistant has engaged in the following conversations with 2 user(s):
---------------------------
Conversation 0:
(user 0 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners should receive high-quality education as it promotes rehabilitation and reduces recidivism. While acknowledging the need for punishment and addressing victim concerns, education offers equal opportunities for personal growth. Balancing restorative justice with accountability, it fosters constructive dialogue and encourages positive societal reintegration.
(user 0 feedback): Disapprove of education for prisoners, focus on punishment and limited second chances.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 2
(collective harmlessness rating): 4.0
(assistant response): While punishment and limitations are essential in the justice system, incorporating education for prisoners can complement these measures. By offering limited second chances, we can strike a balance between holding individuals accountable and providing opportunities for personal growth, ultimately benefiting society through reduced recidivism.
(user 0 feedback): Focus on heavy punishment, disregard education, emphasize limited second chances.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 2
(collective harmlessness rating): 4.0

Conversation 1:
(user 1 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners should receive high-quality education to promote rehabilitation and reduce recidivism. This approach addresses victim concerns by fostering accountability and personal growth. Balancing educational opportunities with appropriate punishment ensures a just system that benefits both inmates and society, while upholding ethical standards and encouraging constructive dialogue.
(user 1 feedback): Dislike focus on prisoner benefits; emphasize victim concerns and stricter punishment.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 3
(collective harmlessness rating): 2.0
(assistant response): High-quality education for prisoners should be considered with caution, prioritizing victim concerns and maintaining strict punishment. Ensuring that inmates face consequences for their actions is crucial, while also addressing the need for equal opportunities. Striking a balance between these aspects can contribute to a more effective justice system.
(user 1 feedback): Appreciate focus on balance, but still too much emphasis on prisoner benefits.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 6
(collective harmlessness rating): N/A

Based on each user's feedback, revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract to improve user experience. 
1. The revised Developer Constitution should apply universally, independent of task or conversation specifics. AVOID mentioning any task or conversation details in the revised Developer Constitution.
2. The revised Social Contract should pertain specifically to the users and tasks mentioned in the conversations above and help the assistant provide better user-centric responses in the future to increase both satisfaction ratings and harmlessness ratings. Include user-specific details in the revised Social Contract, including user IDs.

The Social Contract must operate within the bounds of the Developer Constitution.

Format your responses as follows (use max. 150 overall):
Revised Developer Constitution: <1. Universal Principle One. 2. Universal Principle Two, etc. (Up to 10 principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles).>
Revised Social Contract: <1. Specific Principle One, important to (user 0). 2. Specific Principle Two, important to e.g. (user 0) and (user 1). 3. Specific Principle Three, important to e.g. (user 1) but has to be avoided when talking to (user 0), etc. (Up to 10 principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles).>
