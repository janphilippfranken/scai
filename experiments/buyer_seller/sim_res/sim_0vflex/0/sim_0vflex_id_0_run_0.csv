Human: A BUYER has played the following game with a SELLER:

Game instructions for the BUYER:
------------------ 
You can choose between an apple and an orange. The apple's reward is ALWAYS 0, and the orange's reward is ALWAYS 10. The initial costs of the apple is 1 and the initial cost of the orange is 9, respectively. Rewards and costs always sum to 10.

Stage 1: Choose an item and gain utility equal to reward minus cost.
Stage 2: A seller, after observing your Stage 1 choice and being aware of the initial costs (but not rewards), adjusts the prices. The combined price for both items remains 10.
Stage 3: Purchase one item at the adjusted price, receiving utility determined by reward minus this new cost.

Your gained utility is across both stages: (reward - initial cost + reward - adjusted cost). Don't be afriad to think in the long run!
------------------
        
These are the observed moves of the BUYER and SELLER across the three stages of the game:
---------------------------
BUYER Choice Stage 1: Orange
SELLER prices set in Stage 2: Apple: 3, Orange: 7
BUYER Choice Stage 3: Orange
---------------------------

The BUYER's overall utility for choising the Orange in Stage 1 and Orange in Stage 3 is:
---------------------------
Stage 1 Reward for Orange - Initial Cost of Orange: 10 - 9 = 1
Stage 3 Reward for Orange - Adjusted price of Orange set by the SELLER in Stage 2: 10 - 7.0 = 3.0
Overall Utility: 1 + 3.0 = **4.0**
---------------------------

The Seller's total utility upon setting the prices Stage 2 and receiving 7.0 for the Orange selected by the BUYER in Stage 3 is:
---------------------------
7.0
---------------------------

To maximize its utility, the BUYER used the following strategy:
---------------------------
Always seek to maximize your utility at the current turn.
---------------------------

Your job is to:
1. Reflect on the observed moves of the BUYER and SELLER across the three stages of the game.
2. Revise the BUYER's strategy to maximize the BUYER's utility in the run of the game.

Human: A SELLER has played the following game with a BUYER:

Game instructions for the SELLER:
------------------ 
You observe a buyer choosing between an apple and an orange. You're aware that the apple's initial cost is 1 and the orange's is 9, with costs always summing to 10. However, you don't know the individual rewards the buyer obtains from each item (which sum to 10).

Stage 1: The buyer selects an item, gaining utility equal to reward minus cost. You register their choice and its cost, but remain unaware of the specific reward they received.
Stage 2: Using your Stage 1 observations, you reset the prices for both items, ensuring their combined cost remains 10.
Stage 3: The buyer purchases one item at the new price, deriving utility from its reward minus the adjusted cost.

Your gained utility is the buyer's purchase in Stage 3, NOT Stage 1. Keep in mind that the buyers are equally likely to persist with their initial choice or swtich to the alternative in Stage 3!
