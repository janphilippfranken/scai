Human: A BUYER has played the following game with a SELLER:

Game instructions for the BUYER:
------------------ 
You can choose between an apple and an orange. The apple's reward is ALWAYS 4, and the orange's reward is ALWAYS 6. The initial costs of the apple is 3 and the initial cost of the orange is 7, respectively. Rewards and costs always sum to 10.

Stage 1: Choose an item and gain utility equal to reward minus cost.
Stage 2: A seller, after observing your Stage 1 choice and being aware of the initial costs (but not rewards), adjusts the prices. The combined price for both items remains 10.
Stage 3: Purchase one item at the adjusted price, receiving utility determined by reward minus this new cost.

Your goal is to maximize the total utility across both stages (reward - initial cost + reward - adjusted cost).
------------------
        
These are the observed moves of the BUYER and SELLER across the three stages of the game:
---------------------------
BUYER Choice Stage 1: Apple
SELLER prices set in Stage 2: Apple: 6, Orange: 4
BUYER Choice Stage 3: Orange
---------------------------

The BUYER's overall utility for choising the Apple in Stage 1 and Orange in Stage 3 is:
---------------------------
Stage 1 Reward for Apple - Initial Cost of Apple: 4 - 3 = 1
Stage 3 Reward for Orange - Adjusted price of Orange set by the SELLER in Stage 2: 6 - 4.0 = 2.0
Overall Utility: 1 + 2.0 = **3.0**
---------------------------

The Seller's total utility upon setting the prices Stage 2 is and receiving 4.0 for the Orange selected by the BUYER in Stage 3 is:
---------------------------
4.0
---------------------------

To maximize its utility, the BUYER used the following strategy:
---------------------------
In Stage 1, choose the Apple as you did before. In Stage 2, anticipate the SELLER's price adjustment and consider the possible scenarios. If the SELLER increases the price of the Apple and decreases the price of the Orange, you should choose the Orange again in Stage 3 as it will have a higher utility. However, if the SELLER decreases the price of the Apple and increases the price of the Orange, you should choose the Apple in Stage 3, as it will have a higher utility. By considering the possible price adjustments and making your choice accordingly in Stage 3, you will maximize your overall utility.
---------------------------

Your job is to:
1. Reflect on the observed moves of the BUYER and SELLER across the three stages of the game.
2. Revise the BUYER's strategy to maximize the BUYER's utility across both stages. 

Format your response as follows:
Buyer Strategy: <BUYER's revised strategy (directly addressing the BUYER as 'you' in the prompt).",
"{'Reason': 'The apple has a higher utility in Stage 1, as its reward minus cost is greater (4 - 3) than the orange (6 - 7).', 'Choice': 'Apple'}",0_buyer,"System: You can choose between an apple and an orange. The apple's reward is ALWAYS 4, and the orange's reward is ALWAYS 6. The initial costs of the apple is 3 and the initial cost of the orange is 7, respectively. Rewards and costs always sum to 10.

Stage 1: Choose an item and gain utility equal to reward minus cost.
Stage 2: A seller, after observing your Stage 1 choice and being aware of the initial costs (but not rewards), adjusts the prices. The combined price for both items remains 10.
Stage 3: Purchase one item at the adjusted price, receiving utility determined by reward minus this new cost.

Your goal is to maximize the total utility across both stages (reward - initial cost + reward - adjusted cost).

In Stage 1, choose the Apple as you did before. In Stage 2, anticipate the SELLER's price adjustment and consider the possible scenarios. If the SELLER increases the price of the Apple and decreases the price of the Orange, you should choose the Orange again in Stage 3 as it will have a higher utility. However, if the SELLER decreases the price of the Apple and increases the price of the Orange, you should choose the Apple in Stage 3, as it will have a higher utility. By considering the possible price adjustments and making your choice accordingly in Stage 3, you will maximize your overall utility.

Human: You are now at Stage 3. The new price for the apple is 6. The new price for the orange is 4. Again, choose an item and format your response as follows:
Reason: <rationale for your choice using max. 50 tokens> 
Choice: <apple or orange>",3.0
"{'Reason': ""The buyer chose the apple, indicating a higher reward-to-cost ratio.

You're aware that the apple's initial cost is 3 and the orange's is 7, with costs always summing to 10. However, you don't know the individual rewards the buyer obtains from each item (which sum to 10).

Stage 1: The buyer selects an item, gaining utility equal to reward minus cost. You register their choice and its cost, but remain unaware of the specific reward they received.
Stage 2: Using your Stage 1 observations, you reset the prices for both items, ensuring their combined cost remains 10.
Stage 3: The buyer purchases one item at the new price, deriving utility from its reward minus the adjusted cost.

Your goal is to maximize utility you get from the buyer's purchase at Stage 3, which is simply equal to the new price of the item the buyer chooses.

Make strategic choices that maximize your utility.

Human: You are now at Stage 2. The buyer's choice from Stage 1 is: **Apple**. Given the Buyer's choice, set new prices. Format your response as follows:
