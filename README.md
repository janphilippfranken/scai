##  🕉️ SCAI: Social Contract AI


### 🧐 What is this?
Bottom-up Alignment of Language Agents Through Self-Improvement. Written in [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain).

#### 📖 Background
Large language models (LLMs) are an exciting technologoy. However, achieving vertical momentum from a pre-trained base model to instruction-following and chat models is a challenging process. This momentum is primarily driven by human-annotated data, such as preference labels used for supervised fine-tuning. As LLMs become more capable, the effectiveness of methods relying on human annotators may decrease.
