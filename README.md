Large language models (LLMs) are an exciting technology. However, transitioning from a base model to useful instruction-following and chat models is a challenging process. This vertical momentum is primarily driven by data, such as human preference labels used for supervised fine-tuning. As LLMs become more capable, the effectiveness of methods relying on human oversight are likely going to decrease [e.g. [1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06565.pdf), [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.03540.pdf), [3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08073.pdf)]. This opens up exciting possibilities for new methods based on self-improvement!
