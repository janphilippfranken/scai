##  🕉️ SCAI: Social Contract AI

Useful, self-improving language agents. Written in [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain).


#### 📖 Background
Large Language Models (LLMs) are 😍🚀. Transforming base models into useful instruction-following and chat models requires additional fine-tuning. This vertical momentum is primarily driven by data like human demonstrations or preference labels  [e.g. [1](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/b1efde53be364a73914f58805a001731-Paper-Conference.pdf)]. However, as LLMs become more capable, the effectiveness of methods relying on human oversight is likely going to decrease [e.g. [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06565.pdf), [3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.03540.pdf), [4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08073.pdf)]. This opens up exciting possibilities for new data-generation methods based on self-improvement [e.g. [5](https://noahgoodman.substack.com/p/meta-prompt-a-simple-self-improving)].
