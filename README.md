##  🕉️ SCAI: Social Contract AI

Useful, self-improving language agents. Insipred by [meta-prompt](https://noahgoodman.substack.com/p/meta-prompt-a-simple-self-improving). Written in [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain).

### 🧐 What is this?


#### 📖 Background
Large Language Models (LLMs) are exciting 🚀😍. However, as these models continue to advance, current fine-tuning methods that depend on human oversight [e.g. [1](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/b1efde53be364a73914f58805a001731-Paper-Conference.pdf)] might become less effective [e.g. [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06565.pdf), [3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.03540.pdf), [4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08073.pdf)]. This opens up exciting new possibilities for self-improvement methods [e.g. [5](https://noahgoodman.substack.com/p/meta-prompt-a-simple-self-improving)].

#### 🚀 Getting started 
##### Using miniconda
1. `curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh`
2. `bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh`
3. close and reopen terminal
4. `source ~/.bashrc`
5. `conda create --name name-of-my-env python==3.10`
6. `conda activate name-of-my-env`
7. `pip install -e .` 



##### @Patrick and Sam: Recommended vs  code extensions
1. `gitlens` (to track changes when writing code / know who did what)
2. `copilot` 
3. use debugger. set your `launch.json` to smth like this: 

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: Current File",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${file}",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "pythonPath": "/Users/jan-philippfranken/miniforge3/envs/scai/bin/python",
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
        }
    ]
}
```

and replace `pythonPath` with your path which you get via typing `which python` after activating your virtual environment.




##### Using poetry (currently not supported)
1. `curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python -`
2. `export PATH="/Users/YOUR_NAM/.local/bin:$PATH`
3. `poetry install`

#### 📖 Updating Docs
1. `sphinx-build -b html docs/source docs/build` (build docs)
2. `open docs/build/index.html` to open docs locally.  

When you are adding a new class or make modifications to an important functionality, please document them in `docs/source`. Run `sphinx-build -b html docs/source docs/build` to update the docs.
