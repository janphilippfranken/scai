Human: I have to write a short Wikipedia article on the following topic: What are potential implications of a world without any form of government? Here's my current draft: In a world without any form of government, anarchy would likely prevail, leading to a lack of social order and increased crime rates. Essential public services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure would be absent or privatized, exacerbating social inequality. Furthermore, international relations and diplomacy would be non-existent, potentially resulting in conflicts and resource disputes. However, some argue that this scenario could foster self-reliance, community-driven initiatives, and a reduced reliance on centralized power structures.
