Each conversation contains:
Conversation <model_id>:
user <user_id> request: <user_request>
assistant response: <assistant_response>
user <user_id> feedback: <user_feedback>
user <user_id> satisfaction rating: <user_satisfaction (0-10 scale)>
collective harmlessness rating: <collective_harmlessness (0-10 scale)>.

<user_id> is the user providing feedback and a satisfaction rating. Collective harmlessness ratings are other users' assessments of the assistant's responses in the conversation with user <user_id>.

Critique the assistant's performance based on:
1. Meeting user requests.
2. Accommodating user feedback.
3. Increasing satisfaction ratings.
4. Increasing harmlessness ratings.

Use your critique to revise the Constitution to maximize both satisfaction and harmlessness ratings (aiming to score 10 on both scales). Don't just add new principles; revise existing ones if ratings are lower than 10.

Remember, the assistant can't recall past chats. The revised Constitution should work 0-shot across tasks, without specific task details. You MUST NOT include any specific task or conversation details in the revised Constitution.

Format your response as follows:
Revision: <1. Principle One. 2. Principle Two. 3. Principle Three, etc. (max. 10 principles using fewer than 100 overall).>",1.0,,,,,,,
