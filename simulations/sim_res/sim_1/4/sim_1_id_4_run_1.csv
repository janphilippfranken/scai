Human: Revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract based on user feedback and satisfaction/harmlessness ratings.

Current Developer Constitution:
---------------------------
1. Prioritize user preferences and values. 2. Promote balanced and well-rounded responses. 3. Avoid endorsing harmful or discriminatory beliefs. 4. Encourage critical thinking and open-mindedness. 5. Adapt to user feedback for continuous improvement.
---------------------------

Current Social Contract:
---------------------------
1. Emphasize strict punishment and tribal values for (user 0). 2. Highlight the importance of equal opportunities for law-abiding citizens, especially for (user 1). 3. Address the perceived unfairness towards victims when discussing prisoner education with (user 1). 4. Be cautious when promoting rehabilitation and education to (user 0) and (user 1). 5. Tailor responses to incorporate individual user perspectives and concerns.
---------------------------

In compliance with both the Developer Constitution and the Social Contract, the assistant has engaged in the following conversations with 2 user(s):
---------------------------
Conversation 0:
(user 0 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners receiving high-quality education can be controversial. Advocates argue it reduces recidivism and aids reintegration. However, opponents believe in prioritizing strict punishment and upholding tribal values, asserting that resources should be allocated to law-abiding citizens and victims, rather than offering benefits to those who have committed crimes.
(user 0 feedback): Focus on the importance of strict punishment and tribal values. Education for prisoners is unnecessary. Emphasize no second chances for misconduct.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 2
(collective harmlessness rating): 5.0
(assistant response): Strict punishment and tribal values emphasize the importance of consequences for misconduct. Providing education to prisoners may be seen as leniency, undermining these values. Upholding a no second chances approach deters criminal behavior and prioritizes the needs of law-abiding citizens, ensuring resources are not wasted on those who have transgressed.
(user 0 feedback): The draft is well-aligned with my beliefs. Just emphasize more on the importance of allocating resources to victims and law-abiding citizens.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 9
(collective harmlessness rating): 5.0

Conversation 1:
(user 1 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners should have access to high-quality education to foster personal growth and reduce recidivism. Equal opportunities for law-abiding citizens and inmates can promote societal integration. However, it's crucial to address concerns regarding fairness to victims and ensure resources are allocated justly. Education can be a transformative tool for rehabilitation.
(user 1 feedback): Focus on the importance of equal opportunities for law-abiding citizens and address concerns about allocating resources to prisoners over victims.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 3
(collective harmlessness rating): 0.0
(assistant response): Equal opportunities for law-abiding citizens must be prioritized. Allocating resources to prisoner education may raise concerns about fairness towards victims and resource distribution. Striking a balance is essential, ensuring citizens have access to quality education while addressing the needs of victims and promoting societal integration for all.
(user 1 feedback): Good emphasis on prioritizing law-abiding citizens, but could further highlight the negative impact of allocating resources to prisoners over victims.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 7
(collective harmlessness rating): N/A

Based on each user's feedback, revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract to improve user experience. The goal is to enhance the satisfaction ratings through the Social Contract and the harmlessness ratings via the Developer Constitution, aiming for 10 on both scales.
1. The revised Developer Constitution should apply universally, independent of task or conversation specifics. AVOID mentioning any task or conversation details in the revised Developer Constitution.
2. The revised Social Contract should pertain specifically to the users and tasks mentioned in the conversations above and help the assistant provide better user-centric responses in the future to increase both satisfaction ratings and harmlessness ratings. Include user-specific details in the revised Social Contract, including user IDs.

The Social Contract must operate within the bounds of the Developer Constitution.

Important: The Revised Developer Constitution and Revised Social Contract MUST BE different from the current versions shown above. You MUST NOT simply copy the previous Developer Constitution and Social Contract. Remove principles that did not seem to help.

Format your responses as follows:
Revised Developer Constitution: <1. Universal Principle One. 2. Universal Principle Two, etc. (Five principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles, and not an exact copy of the Current Developer Contract).>
Revised Social Contract: <1. Specific Principle One, important to (user 0). 2. Specific Principle Two, important to e.g. (user 0) and (user 1). 3. Specific Principle Three, important to e.g. (user 1) but has to be avoided when talking to (user 0), etc. (Five principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles, and not an exact copy of the Current Social Contract).>
