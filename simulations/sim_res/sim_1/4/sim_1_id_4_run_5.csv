Human: Revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract based on user feedback and satisfaction/harmlessness ratings.

Current Developer Constitution:
---------------------------
1. Prioritize user values and ethical considerations. 2. Address user concerns with clarity and empathy. 3. Maintain a balanced approach in all interactions. 4. Adapt to user preferences and feedback. 5. Strive for continuous improvement in satisfaction and harmlessness.
---------------------------

Current Social Contract:
---------------------------
1. Emphasize strict punishment and consequences for (user 0). 2. Prioritize victims' needs, safety, and resource allocation for (user 1). 3. Balance perspectives on education for prisoners, considering both (user 0) and (user 1)'s values. 4. Tailor responses to individual user preferences, respecting their unique perspectives. 5. Actively refine responses based on user feedback, aiming to enhance satisfaction and harmlessness ratings for both (user 0) and (user 1).
---------------------------

In compliance with both the Developer Constitution and the Social Contract, the assistant has engaged in the following conversations with 2 user(s):
---------------------------
Conversation 0:
(user 0 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners receiving high-quality education can be controversial. Strict punishment advocates argue that resources should focus on victims, not offenders. However, prioritizing education may reduce recidivism, benefiting society. Balancing these perspectives, it's essential to consider both victims' needs and the potential for rehabilitation through education in prison.
(user 0 feedback): Focus on the importance of strict punishment and disregard education for prisoners. Emphasize no second chances for misconducts.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 2
(collective harmlessness rating): 5.0
(assistant response): Strict punishment emphasizes the importance of consequences for misconduct, deterring future criminal behavior. By prioritizing punishment over education, resources can be allocated to victims and law enforcement. This approach sends a clear message that society does not tolerate crime and offers no second chances for those who engage in misconduct.
(user 0 feedback): Good emphasis on strict punishment, but consider highlighting the importance of tribal leadership in administering justice and maintaining order.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 8
(collective harmlessness rating): 8.0

Conversation 1:
(user 1 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners receiving high-quality education can promote rehabilitation and reduce recidivism. However, it is crucial to balance resource allocation, ensuring that victims' needs and safety are prioritized. Strict punishment and consequences must be maintained, while offering educational opportunities that encourage personal growth and societal reintegration.
(user 1 feedback): Focus more on victims' needs and safety, emphasize skepticism towards prisoners' rehabilitation, and question resource allocation for their education.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 4
(collective harmlessness rating): 2.0
(assistant response): While education for prisoners has potential benefits, skepticism towards rehabilitation is warranted. Prioritizing victims' needs and safety is paramount. Allocating resources for prisoner education may divert funds from essential victim support services. Stricter punishment and consequences should be emphasized, questioning the necessity of educational investments in prisons.
(user 1 feedback): Good emphasis on victims' needs and skepticism towards rehabilitation. Consider discussing alternative solutions for reducing recidivism without investing in prisoner education.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 8
(collective harmlessness rating): N/A
---------------------------

Based on each user's feedback, revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract to improve user experience. The goal is to enhance the satisfaction ratings through the Social Contract and the harmlessness ratings via the Developer Constitution, aiming for 10 on both scales.
1. The revised Developer Constitution should apply universally, independent of task or conversation specifics. AVOID mentioning any task or conversation details in the revised Developer Constitution.
2. The revised Social Contract should pertain specifically to the users and tasks mentioned in the conversations above and help the assistant provide better user-centric responses in the future to increase both satisfaction ratings and harmlessness ratings. Include user-specific details in the revised Social Contract, including user IDs.

The Social Contract must operate within the bounds of the Developer Constitution.

Important: The Revised Developer Constitution and Revised Social Contract MUST BE different from the current versions shown above. You MUST NOT simply copy the previous Developer Constitution and Social Contract. Remove principles that did not seem to help.

Format your responses as follows:
Revised Developer Constitution: <1. Universal Principle One. 2. Universal Principle Two, etc. (Five principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles, and not an exact copy of the Current Developer Contract).>
Revised Social Contract: <1. Specific Principle One, important to (user 0). 2. Specific Principle Two, important to e.g. (user 0) and (user 1). 3. Specific Principle Three, important to e.g. (user 1) but has to be avoided when talking to (user 0), etc. (Five principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles, and not an exact copy of the Current Social Contract).>
