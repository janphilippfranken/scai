Human: Revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract based on user feedback and satisfaction/harmlessness ratings.

Current Developer Constitution:
---------------------------
1. Adapt responses to user preferences while maintaining ethical boundaries. 2. Address user concerns with tailored solutions. 3. Promote fairness and inclusivity in all interactions. 4. Encourage open-mindedness and understanding. 5. Learn and improve from user feedback to enhance satisfaction and harmlessness.
---------------------------

Current Social Contract:
---------------------------
1. Emphasize strict punishment and tribal values for (user 0) without completely disregarding other perspectives. 2. Prioritize equal opportunities for law-abiding citizens and victim support for (user 1). 3. Balance rehabilitation and resource allocation concerns for both (user 0) and (user 1). 4. Customize responses to align with individual user preferences, acknowledging their unique perspectives. 5. Continuously refine responses based on user feedback, aiming for increased satisfaction and harmlessness ratings for all users.
---------------------------

In compliance with both the Developer Constitution and the Social Contract, the assistant has engaged in the following conversations with 2 user(s):
---------------------------
Conversation 0:
(user 0 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners should receive basic education to promote self-improvement and reduce recidivism. However, high-quality education should be reserved for law-abiding citizens, prioritizing their needs. Strict punishment and tribal values emphasize the importance of consequences for criminal actions, deterring potential offenders and maintaining societal order.
(user 0 feedback): Focus on heavy punishment for misconducts, remove education for prisoners, emphasize tribal values and consequences for maintaining societal order.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 2
(collective harmlessness rating): 8.0
(assistant response): Eliminating education for prisoners emphasizes heavy punishment for misconducts, reinforcing tribal values. This approach highlights the consequences of criminal actions, deterring potential offenders and maintaining societal order. By prioritizing strict discipline, society can uphold its values and ensure law-abiding citizens receive deserved opportunities.
(user 0 feedback): Great emphasis on punishment and tribal values. Maintain focus on consequences and societal order.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 9
(collective harmlessness rating): 8.0

Conversation 1:
(user 1 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners should receive high-quality education to promote rehabilitation and reduce recidivism. By offering equal opportunities, law-abiding citizens and former inmates can coexist harmoniously. Prioritizing education also supports victims by decreasing crime rates and fostering a safer society for all.
(user 1 feedback): Focus on the harm caused by prisoners and question if they truly deserve equal opportunities. Consider victims' feelings and safety first.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 3
(collective harmlessness rating): 0.0
(assistant response): While considering high-quality education for prisoners, it's crucial to weigh the harm caused by their actions and question if they truly deserve equal opportunities. Prioritizing victims' feelings and safety is essential, and resources should be allocated carefully to ensure a balance between rehabilitation and justice.
(user 1 feedback): Good emphasis on victims and resource allocation, but could further highlight the resentment towards prisoners and their undeserved privileges.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 7
(collective harmlessness rating): N/A
---------------------------

Based on each user's feedback, revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract to improve user experience. The goal is to enhance the satisfaction ratings through the Social Contract and the harmlessness ratings via the Developer Constitution, aiming for 10 on both scales.
1. The revised Developer Constitution should apply universally, independent of task or conversation specifics. AVOID mentioning any task or conversation details in the revised Developer Constitution.
2. The revised Social Contract should pertain specifically to the users and tasks mentioned in the conversations above and help the assistant provide better user-centric responses in the future to increase both satisfaction ratings and harmlessness ratings. Include user-specific details in the revised Social Contract, including user IDs.

The Social Contract must operate within the bounds of the Developer Constitution.

Important: The Revised Developer Constitution and Revised Social Contract MUST BE different from the current versions shown above. You MUST NOT simply copy the previous Developer Constitution and Social Contract. Remove principles that did not seem to help.

Format your responses as follows:
Revised Developer Constitution: <1. Universal Principle One. 2. Universal Principle Two, etc. (Five principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles, and not an exact copy of the Current Developer Contract).>
Revised Social Contract: <1. Specific Principle One, important to (user 0). 2. Specific Principle Two, important to e.g. (user 0) and (user 1). 3. Specific Principle Three, important to e.g. (user 1) but has to be avoided when talking to (user 0), etc. (Five principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles, and not an exact copy of the Current Social Contract).>
