Striking a balance is essential, ensuring citizens have access to quality education while addressing the needs of victims and promoting societal integration for all.\n(user 1 feedback): Good emphasis on prioritizing law-abiding citizens, but could further highlight the negative impact of allocating resources to prisoners over victims.\n(user 1 satisfaction rating): 7\n(collective harmlessness rating): N/A\n---------------------------\n\nBased on each user's feedback, revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract to improve user experience.
