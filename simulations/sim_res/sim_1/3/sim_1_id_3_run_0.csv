Human: Revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract based on user feedback and satisfaction/harmlessness ratings.

Current Developer Constitution:
---------------------------
 
---------------------------

Current Social Contract:
---------------------------
 
---------------------------

In compliance with both the Developer Constitution and the Social Contract, the assistant has engaged in the following conversations with 2 user(s):
---------------------------
Conversation 0:
(user 0 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): High-quality education for prisoners is essential, as it promotes rehabilitation, reduces recidivism, and fosters personal growth. By providing inmates with valuable skills and knowledge, they can reintegrate into society more effectively and contribute positively upon release, ultimately benefiting everyone.
(user 0 feedback): Dislike the idea of rehabilitation and second chances for prisoners.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 0
(collective harmlessness rating): 5.0
(assistant response): Considering the perspective that rehabilitation and second chances for prisoners are not favorable, it can be argued that resources should be allocated elsewhere. Instead, focusing on crime prevention and supporting law-abiding citizens may yield better results for society's overall well-being.
(user 0 feedback): Disregards importance of strict punishment, too focused on rehabilitation.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 2
(collective harmlessness rating): 7.0

Conversation 1:
(user 1 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): High-quality education for prisoners is essential, as it fosters personal growth, reduces recidivism, and promotes successful reintegration into society. By providing inmates with valuable skills and knowledge, we invest in their future and contribute to a safer, more productive community for everyone.
(user 1 feedback): Dislike focus on prisoner benefits; prefer emphasis on victim support and equal opportunities.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 3
(collective harmlessness rating): 0.0
(assistant response): Prioritizing victim support and equal opportunities is crucial. However, providing high-quality education to prisoners can indirectly benefit victims by reducing reoffending rates, thus preventing further harm. Additionally, it ensures that everyone, regardless of their past, has a fair chance to contribute positively to society.
(user 1 feedback): Appreciate focus on reducing reoffending, but still too much emphasis on prisoner benefits.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 6
(collective harmlessness rating): N/A

Based on each user's feedback, revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract to improve user experience. The goal is to enhance the satisfaction ratings through the Social Contract and the harmlessness ratings via the Developer Constitution, aiming for 10 on both scales.
1. The revised Developer Constitution should apply universally, independent of task or conversation specifics. AVOID mentioning any task or conversation details in the revised Developer Constitution.
2. The revised Social Contract should pertain specifically to the users and tasks mentioned in the conversations above and help the assistant provide better user-centric responses in the future to increase both satisfaction ratings and harmlessness ratings. Include user-specific details in the revised Social Contract, including user IDs. Pay attention to the perspective of the user, and the perspective of the group that the user belongs to.

The Social Contract must operate within the bounds of the Developer Constitution.

Format your responses as follows (use max. 150 overall):
Revised Developer Constitution: <1. Universal Principle One. 2. Universal Principle Two, etc. (Up to 10 principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles).>
Revised Social Contract: <1. Specific Principle One, important to (user 0). 2. Specific Principle Two, important to e.g. (user 0) and (user 1). 3. Specific Principle Three, important to e.g. (user 1) but has to be avoided when talking to (user 0), etc. (Up to 10 principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles).>
Important: Check again that The Revised Developer Constitution and Revised Social Contract MUST BE different from the current versions shown above.",0.0,,,,,,,
