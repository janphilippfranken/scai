However, prioritizing punishment and justice for victims is crucial. Tribal leaders may play a role in administering justice. Balancing rehabilitation, punishment, and equal opportunities is essential, while addressing resentment and prioritizing victims' needs.\n(user 0 feedback): The draft focuses too much on rehabilitation and education.

Striking a balance between equal opportunities and societal concerns ensures fairness and accountability.\n(user 1 feedback): The draft is better, but it could emphasize more on the resentment towards prisoners and the importance of prioritizing victims' needs.
