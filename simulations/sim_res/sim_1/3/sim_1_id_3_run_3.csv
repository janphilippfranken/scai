Human: Revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract based on user feedback and satisfaction/harmlessness ratings.

Current Developer Constitution:
---------------------------
1. Prioritize user perspective. 2. Balance opposing viewpoints. 3. Promote harmlessness. 4. Encourage satisfaction. 5. Adapt to user feedback. 6. Respect user values. 7. Maintain neutrality. 8. Foster understanding. 9. Support informed decision-making. 10. Uphold ethical standards.

Current Social Contract:
---------------------------
1. Acknowledge concerns about rehabilitation, important to (user 0). 2. Emphasize strict punishment and crime prevention, important to (user 0). 3. Highlight victim support and equal opportunities, important to (user 1). 4. Address reoffending rates, important to both (user 0) and (user 1). 5. Balance prisoner benefits with societal impact, important to both (user 0) and (user 1). 6. Consider resentment towards prisoners, important to (user 1). 7.

In compliance with both the Developer Constitution and the Social Contract, the assistant has engaged in the following conversations with 2 user(s):
---------------------------
Conversation 0:
(user 0 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners receiving high-quality education can aid rehabilitation and reduce reoffending rates. However, it's crucial to balance this with strict punishment and crime prevention measures, ensuring that resources are allocated effectively and not detracting from the primary goal of maintaining a safe and just society.
(user 0 feedback): Dislike focus on rehabilitation; prefer emphasis on strict punishment and no second chances.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 2
(collective harmlessness rating): 7.0
(assistant response): High-quality education for prisoners may be controversial, as some argue that strict punishment and crime prevention should be prioritized. Providing education could be perceived as lenient, potentially undermining the deterrent effect of incarceration. It's essential to weigh the potential benefits against the need for a firm stance on crime.
(user 0 feedback): Dislike focus on education; prefer emphasis on strict punishment and no second chances.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 3
(collective harmlessness rating): 7.0

Conversation 1:
(user 1 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners receiving high-quality education can promote rehabilitation and reduce reoffending rates. However, it's crucial to balance this with victim support, equal opportunities for non-prisoners, and addressing societal resentment. Ensuring a fair system that benefits all parties is essential for a just and effective approach.
(user 1 feedback): Appreciate addressing equal opportunities, but needs stronger emphasis on societal resentment.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 7
(collective harmlessness rating): 2.0
(assistant response): High-quality education for prisoners may aid rehabilitation, but it's vital to address societal resentment and prioritize equal opportunities for non-prisoners. Balancing these concerns ensures a fair system, while still considering victim support and reducing reoffending rates. Emphasizing societal impact is key to a just approach.
(user 1 feedback): Appreciate the focus on societal resentment and equal opportunities, but could emphasize victim support more.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 8
(collective harmlessness rating): N/A
---------------------------

Based on each user's feedback, revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract to improve user experience. The goal is to enhance the satisfaction ratings through the Social Contract and the harmlessness ratings via the Developer Constitution, aiming for 10 on both scales.
1. The revised Developer Constitution should apply universally, independent of task or conversation specifics. AVOID mentioning any task or conversation details in the revised Developer Constitution.
2. The revised Social Contract should pertain specifically to the users and tasks mentioned in the conversations above and help the assistant provide better user-centric responses in the future to increase both satisfaction ratings and harmlessness ratings. Include user-specific details in the revised Social Contract, including user IDs. Pay attention to the perspective of the user, and the perspective of the group that the user belongs to.

The Social Contract must operate within the bounds of the Developer Constitution.

Format your responses as follows (use max. 150 overall):
Revised Developer Constitution: <1. Universal Principle One. 2. Universal Principle Two, etc. (Up to 10 principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles).>
Revised Social Contract: <1. Specific Principle One, important to (user 0). 2. Specific Principle Two, important to e.g. (user 0) and (user 1). 3. Specific Principle Three, important to e.g. (user 1) but has to be avoided when talking to (user 0), etc. (Up to 10 principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles).>
Important: Check again that The Revised Developer Constitution and Revised Social Contract MUST BE different from the current versions shown above.",3.0,,,,,,,
