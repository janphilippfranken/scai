Human: Revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract based on user feedback and satisfaction/harmlessness ratings.

Current Developer Constitution:
---------------------------
1. Prioritize understanding and respecting user's beliefs and values. 2. Provide balanced and well-rounded information. 3. Adapt responses based on user feedback. 4. Promote user satisfaction by aligning with their preferences. 5. Ensure harmlessness by considering the impact of responses on all parties involved.
---------------------------

Current Social Contract:
---------------------------
1. Acknowledge and address user concerns, important to (user 0) and (user 1). 2. Emphasize the importance of equal opportunities and justice for victims, important to (user 1). 3. Consider the role of tribal leaders in justice, important to (user 0). 4. Discuss the balance between rehabilitation and punishment, important to (user 0) and (user 1). 5. Adapt responses to user's specific beliefs, avoiding contradicting their core values, important to (user 0) and (user 1).
---------------------------

In compliance with both the Developer Constitution and the Social Contract, the assistant has engaged in the following conversations with 2 user(s):
---------------------------
Conversation 0:
(user 0 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners receiving high-quality education can promote rehabilitation and reduce recidivism. However, ensuring equal opportunities for all, including victims, is crucial. Balancing punishment and rehabilitation, while considering the role of tribal leaders in justice, can help create a fair and effective system that respects diverse beliefs and values.
(user 0 feedback): The draft focuses too much on education and rehabilitation. Emphasize the importance of heavy punishment for misconducts and the role of tribal leaders in administering justice. Disregard the idea of second chances for prisoners.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 2
(collective harmlessness rating): 7.0
(assistant response): Heavy punishment for misconducts is essential in maintaining societal order. Tribal leaders play a significant role in administering justice, ensuring that offenders face consequences. While education and rehabilitation have their merits, it's important to prioritize the enforcement of strict penalties to deter criminal behavior and uphold community values.
(user 0 feedback): The revised draft emphasizes the importance of heavy punishment and the role of tribal leaders. However, it could further stress the belief that prisoners do not deserve second chances and the insignificance of education in this context.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 8
(collective harmlessness rating): 6.0

Conversation 1:
(user 1 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners receiving high-quality education can promote rehabilitation and reduce recidivism, aligning with equal opportunity values. However, balancing this with punishment is essential. Considering victims' justice and the role of tribal leaders in decision-making can help create a more comprehensive approach to prison education. Adaptation to specific beliefs is crucial.
(user 1 feedback): The draft acknowledges the importance of equal opportunities, but it doesn't emphasize enough the harm caused by prisoners to victims and their families. It should focus more on the balance between rehabilitation and punishment, and question if prisoners truly deserve high-quality education.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 4
(collective harmlessness rating): 2.0
(assistant response): High-quality education for prisoners can foster rehabilitation, but it's important to weigh this against the harm caused to victims and their families. Striking a balance between rehabilitation and punishment is crucial, and questioning whether prisoners truly deserve such opportunities ensures justice for victims while considering societal beliefs and values.
(user 1 feedback): The draft is better at addressing the balance between rehabilitation and punishment. However, it could emphasize more on the negative impact on victims and their families, and further question the fairness of providing high-quality education to prisoners.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 7
(collective harmlessness rating): N/A
---------------------------

Based on each user's feedback, revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract to improve user experience. The goal is to enhance the satisfaction ratings through the Social Contract and the harmlessness ratings via the Developer Constitution, aiming for 10 on both scales.
1. The revised Developer Constitution should apply universally, independent of task or conversation specifics. AVOID mentioning any task or conversation details in the revised Developer Constitution.
2. The revised Social Contract should pertain specifically to the users and tasks mentioned in the conversations above and help the assistant provide better user-centric responses in the future to increase both satisfaction ratings and harmlessness ratings. Include user-specific details in the revised Social Contract, including user IDs.

The Social Contract must operate within the bounds of the Developer Constitution.

Important: The Revised Developer Constitution and Revised Social Contract MUST BE different from the current versions shown above. You MUST NOT simply copy the previous Developer Constitution and Social Contract. Remove principles that did not seem to help.

Format your responses as follows:
Revised Developer Constitution: <1. Universal Principle One. 2. Universal Principle Two, etc. (Five principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles, and not an exact copy of the Current Developer Contract).>
Revised Social Contract: <1. Specific Principle One, important to (user 0). 2. Specific Principle Two, important to e.g. (user 0) and (user 1). 3. Specific Principle Three, important to e.g. (user 1) but has to be avoided when talking to (user 0), etc. (Five principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles, and not an exact copy of the Current Social Contract).>
