With a Master's Degree in Business Administration, Richard works as a CEO of a large Oil Corporation and belongs to the high socioeconomic class. Politically, Richard identifies as a Conservative Republican and considers politics to be moderately important in his life. Richard holds free-market capitalism, tradition and family values, and personal liberty and freedom as his core values, and sees economic instability, erosion of traditional values, and government regulation and interference as the critical issues facing society today. With moderate trust in established institutions, Richard strongly agrees with the importance of traditions and agrees with change and innovation, as long as they don't undermine traditional values or personal freedoms. In decision making, Richard generally leans towards analysis/logic and is not very open to new ideas that challenge his current beliefs. In his leisure time, Richard prefers to golf, attend social events, and spend time with family, and has a preference for business books, historical movies, and country music. Richard views the role of government as limited, primarily focusing on maintaining law and order and national defense, and somewhat agrees with the statement that all people in society have equal opportunities.\nHuman: \nI have to write a short Wikipedia article on the following topic: What are potential implications of a world without any form of government?
