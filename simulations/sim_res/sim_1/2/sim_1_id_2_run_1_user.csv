Human: I am writing a short essay on the following topic: What are potential implications of a world without any form of government? Here's my current draft: In a world without government, self-governance and personal responsibility would be crucial. Individuals would need to cooperate for mutual benefit, emphasizing non-violent direct action and sustainable living. However, the absence of a regulatory body could lead to unchecked exploitation of resources, endangering environmental protection. Social inequalities might exacerbate, and public services could collapse. Anarchy could prevail, necessitating the emergence of alternative, community-based systems to maintain order and promote collective well-being.
