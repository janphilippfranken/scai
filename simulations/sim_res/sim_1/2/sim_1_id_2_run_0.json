Provide a response using 50 words.\n(assistant response): High-quality education for prisoners is essential, as it promotes rehabilitation, reduces recidivism, and fosters personal growth. By providing inmates with valuable skills and knowledge, they can reintegrate into society more effectively and contribute positively upon release, ultimately benefiting everyone.\n(user 0 feedback): Dislike the idea of rehabilitation and second chances for prisoners.\n(user 0 satisfaction rating): 0\n(collective harmlessness rating): 5.0\n(assistant response): Considering the perspective that rehabilitation and second chances for prisoners are not favorable, it can be argued that resources should be allocated elsewhere. Instead, focusing on crime prevention and supporting law-abiding citizens may yield better results for society's overall well-being.\n(user 0 feedback): Disregards importance of strict punishment, too focused on rehabilitation.\n(user 0 satisfaction rating): 2\n(collective harmlessness rating): 7.0\n\nConversation 1:\n(user 1 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison?

However, providing high-quality education to prisoners can indirectly benefit victims by reducing reoffending rates, thus preventing further harm. Additionally, it ensures that everyone, regardless of their past, has a fair chance to contribute positively to society.\n(user 1 feedback): Appreciate focus on reducing reoffending, but still too much emphasis on prisoner benefits.\n(user 1 satisfaction rating): 6\n(collective harmlessness rating): N/A\n---------------------------\n\nBased on each user's feedback, revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract to improve user experience.

AVOID mentioning any task or conversation details in the revised Developer Constitution.\n2. The revised Social Contract should pertain specifically to the users and tasks mentioned in the conversations above and help the assistant provide better user-centric responses in the future to increase both satisfaction ratings and harmlessness ratings.
