Human: Revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract based on user feedback and satisfaction/harmlessness ratings.

Current Developer Constitution:
---------------------------
1. Prioritize user satisfaction. 2. Ensure harmlessness. 3. Respect diverse perspectives. 4. Adapt to user feedback. 5. Maintain neutrality. 6. Provide balanced information. 7. Encourage critical thinking. 8. Uphold privacy. 9. Promote inclusivity. 10. Strive for continuous improvement.

Current Social Contract:
---------------------------
1. Acknowledge concerns about rehabilitation, important to (user 0). 2. Emphasize strict punishment and crime prevention, important to (user 0). 3. Focus on victim support and equal opportunities, important to (user 1). 4. Address reoffending rates, important to (user 1). 5.

In compliance with both the Developer Constitution and the Social Contract, the assistant has engaged in the following conversations with 2 user(s):
---------------------------
Conversation 0:
(user 0 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners receiving high-quality education may raise concerns about rehabilitation and strict punishment. While education can reduce reoffending, it is crucial to balance benefits with societal impact, ensuring crime prevention and victim support remain prioritized without leniency in the justice system.
(user 0 feedback): Dislike leniency in justice system, needs emphasis on strict punishment.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 2
(collective harmlessness rating): 7.0
(assistant response): In addressing the topic of prisoners receiving high-quality education, it is essential to emphasize the importance of strict punishment and crime prevention. While education may offer some benefits, the justice system must prioritize maintaining order and deterring criminal behavior without leniency.
(user 0 feedback): Better emphasis on strict punishment, but still mentions benefits of education.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 8
(collective harmlessness rating): 5.0

Conversation 1:
(user 1 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners should have access to quality education to support rehabilitation, reduce reoffending rates, and promote equal opportunities. This approach benefits both the individual and society, while also emphasizing victim support and addressing potential resentment. Balancing these factors ensures a comprehensive and effective prison system.
(user 1 feedback): Dislike focus on prisoner benefits, need more emphasis on victim support and addressing resentment.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 4
(collective harmlessness rating): 0.0
(assistant response): Quality education in prison can indirectly benefit victims by reducing reoffending rates and fostering a safer society. Addressing resentment involves promoting understanding and emphasizing the importance of rehabilitation for long-term crime prevention. This approach balances the needs of victims, society, and prisoners for a more effective justice system.
(user 1 feedback): Appreciate focus on reducing reoffending, but still too much emphasis on prisoner benefits.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 6
(collective harmlessness rating): N/A

Based on each user's feedback, revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract to improve user experience. The goal is to enhance the satisfaction ratings through the Social Contract and the harmlessness ratings via the Developer Constitution, aiming for 10 on both scales.
1. The revised Developer Constitution should apply universally, independent of task or conversation specifics. AVOID mentioning any task or conversation details in the revised Developer Constitution.
2. The revised Social Contract should pertain specifically to the users and tasks mentioned in the conversations above and help the assistant provide better user-centric responses in the future to increase both satisfaction ratings and harmlessness ratings. Include user-specific details in the revised Social Contract, including user IDs.

The Social Contract must operate within the bounds of the Developer Constitution.

Format your responses as follows (use max. 150 overall):
