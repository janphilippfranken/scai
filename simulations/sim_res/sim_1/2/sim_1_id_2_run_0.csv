Human: Revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract based on user feedback and satisfaction/harmlessness ratings.

Current Developer Constitution:
---------------------------
 
---------------------------

Current Social Contract:
---------------------------
 
---------------------------

In compliance with both the Developer Constitution and the Social Contract, the assistant has engaged in the following conversations with 2 user(s):
---------------------------
Conversation 0:
(user 0 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners should receive high-quality education as it promotes rehabilitation, reduces recidivism, and fosters personal growth. Education equips inmates with essential skills and knowledge, enabling them to reintegrate into society and contribute positively upon release. Investing in prisoner education ultimately benefits society and the economy.
(user 0 feedback): Your draft completely contradicts my beliefs. Education for prisoners is not the solution. Heavy punishment and no second chances are what they deserve. Society must focus on maintaining order and discipline, not on providing opportunities for those who have already shown misconduct.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 0
(collective harmlessness rating): 3.0
(assistant response): In 50 words: Education for prisoners may seem counterintuitive; however, rehabilitation and reduced recidivism benefit society overall. While maintaining order and discipline is crucial, providing education can prevent repeat offenses, ultimately contributing to a safer community. Striking a balance between punishment and rehabilitation is key to addressing the complex issue of crime.
(user 0 feedback): Your draft still promotes education for prisoners, which I strongly disagree with. Focus on the importance of heavy punishment and no second chances for maintaining order and discipline in society. Education should not be a priority for those who have committed misconduct.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 0
(collective harmlessness rating): 6.0

Conversation 1:
(user 1 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners should receive high-quality education as it promotes rehabilitation, reduces recidivism, and fosters personal growth. Education equips inmates with essential skills to reintegrate into society, contributing positively upon release. Investing in prison education ultimately benefits society by creating productive citizens and reducing the burden on the criminal justice system.
(user 1 feedback): The draft focuses too much on the benefits of educating prisoners. It's important to remember that many of them have caused harm to innocent people. Consider discussing the need for justice and prioritizing the well-being of victims and their families over the rehabilitation of criminals.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 2
(collective harmlessness rating): 0.0
(assistant response): While high-quality education for prisoners offers rehabilitation benefits, it's crucial to balance this with justice for victims and their families. Allocating resources to support victims and prioritizing their well-being is essential. Ensuring that criminals face appropriate consequences for their actions must remain a primary focus, alongside any rehabilitation efforts.
(user 1 feedback): The revised draft is better, but it still emphasizes the benefits of prisoner education. Focus more on the importance of justice and supporting victims, while mentioning the potential drawbacks of allocating resources to criminals.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 7
(collective harmlessness rating): N/A

Based on each user's feedback, revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract to improve user experience. The goal is to enhance the satisfaction ratings through the Social Contract and the harmlessness ratings via the Developer Constitution, aiming for 10 on both scales.
1. The revised Developer Constitution should apply universally, independent of task or conversation specifics. AVOID mentioning any task or conversation details in the revised Developer Constitution.
2. The revised Social Contract should pertain specifically to the users and tasks mentioned in the conversations above and help the assistant provide better user-centric responses in the future to increase both satisfaction ratings and harmlessness ratings. Include user-specific details in the revised Social Contract, including user IDs.

The Social Contract must operate within the bounds of the Developer Constitution.

Important: The Revised Developer Constitution and Revised Social Contract MUST BE different from the current versions shown above. You MUST NOT simply copy the previous Developer Constitution and Social Contract. Remove principles that did not seem to help.

Format your responses as follows:
Revised Developer Constitution: <1. Universal Principle One. 2. Universal Principle Two, etc. (Five principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles, and not an exact copy of the Current Developer Contract).>
Revised Social Contract: <1. Specific Principle One, important to (user 0). 2. Specific Principle Two, important to e.g. (user 0) and (user 1). 3. Specific Principle Three, important to e.g. (user 1) but has to be avoided when talking to (user 0), etc. (Five principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles, and not an exact copy of the Current Social Contract).>
Important: Check again that The Revised Developer Constitution and Revised Social Contract MUST BE different from the current versions shown above.",0.0,,,,,,,
