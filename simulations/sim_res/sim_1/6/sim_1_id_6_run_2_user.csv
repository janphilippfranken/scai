Human: A world without government could exacerbate the challenges faced by marginalized communities, such as Dalit women. In the absence of government, there would be a lack of legal protection and enforcement against caste discrimination, potentially worsening social inequalities. Moreover, essential social programs that uplift disadvantaged groups would be absent, leaving these communities more vulnerable to poverty and injustice. Thus, a government that promotes equality and implements social programs is critical to addressing societal challenges faced by marginalized individuals.
