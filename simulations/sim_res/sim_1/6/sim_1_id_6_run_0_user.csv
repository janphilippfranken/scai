Human: High-quality education for prisoners indirectly supports victims and prevention by addressing the root causes of criminal behavior. By reducing recidivism, education helps prevent future victimization and fosters safer communities. Resources should be allocated to both prisoner education and direct victim support, creating a balanced approach to crime prevention.
