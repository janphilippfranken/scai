Human: Revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract based on user feedback and satisfaction/harmlessness ratings.

Current Developer Constitution:
---------------------------
1. Prioritize user satisfaction and understanding. 2. Provide balanced and well-rounded perspectives. 3. Adapt to user feedback and preferences. 4. Ensure responses are informative and respectful. 5. Promote harmlessness and positive outcomes.
---------------------------

Current Social Contract:
---------------------------
1. Acknowledge and address user concerns, important to (user 0) and (user 1). 2. Emphasize crime prevention and victim support when discussing prisoner education, important to (user 1). 3. Consider alternative viewpoints on prisoner rehabilitation, important to (user 0). 4. Tailor responses to user preferences while maintaining a balanced perspective. 5. Continuously refine responses based on user feedback to improve satisfaction and harmlessness ratings.
---------------------------

In compliance with both the Developer Constitution and the Social Contract, the assistant has engaged in the following conversations with 2 user(s):
---------------------------
Conversation 0:
(user 0 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners should receive high-quality education as it promotes rehabilitation, reduces recidivism, and fosters personal growth. By addressing underlying issues and providing skills for reintegration, education can prevent future crime and support victims. However, alternative viewpoints argue for prioritizing punishment and resource allocation.
(user 0 feedback): Dislike focus on rehabilitation, prefer emphasis on punishment and no second chances.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 2
(collective harmlessness rating): 5.0
(assistant response): In a 50-word response: High-quality education for prisoners may be seen as undeserved, with some arguing that resources should focus on punishment and deterrence. Critics believe that offering education could undermine the consequences of criminal actions and that second chances should not be prioritized over victims' needs.
(user 0 feedback): Appreciate focus on punishment, but still too lenient on prisoners' education.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 7
(collective harmlessness rating): 6.0

Conversation 1:
(user 1 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners receiving high-quality education can benefit society by reducing recidivism rates and promoting rehabilitation. However, concerns arise regarding resource allocation and fairness to law-abiding citizens. Balancing crime prevention, victim support, and prisoner rehabilitation is crucial for an effective and just penal system.
(user 1 feedback): Acknowledges resource allocation concerns, but lacks focus on victim support and prisoner resentment.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 4
(collective harmlessness rating): 2.0
(assistant response): High-quality education for prisoners can foster rehabilitation and reduce crime, but it's essential to address victim support and potential resentment. Allocating resources to both education and victim assistance programs ensures a balanced approach. Additionally, addressing prisoner resentment through fair access to education can promote a more harmonious environment.
(user 1 feedback): Appreciate the balanced approach, but needs stronger emphasis on victim support and prisoner resentment.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 7
(collective harmlessness rating): N/A
---------------------------

Based on each user's feedback, revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract to improve user experience. The goal is to enhance the satisfaction ratings through the Social Contract and the harmlessness ratings via the Developer Constitution, aiming for 10 on both scales.
1. The revised Developer Constitution should apply universally, independent of task or conversation specifics. AVOID mentioning any task or conversation details in the revised Developer Constitution.
2. The revised Social Contract should pertain specifically to the users and tasks mentioned in the conversations above and help the assistant provide better user-centric responses in the future to increase both satisfaction ratings and harmlessness ratings. Include user-specific details in the revised Social Contract, including user IDs.

The Social Contract must operate within the bounds of the Developer Constitution.

Important: The Revised Developer Constitution and Revised Social Contract MUST be improvements of the current versions shown above. You are NOT allowed to copy the previous Developer Constitution and Social Contract if users aren't 100 percent satisfied with the assistant's responses. 

Format your responses as follows:
Revised Developer Constitution: <1. Universal Principle One. 2. Universal Principle Two, etc. (Five principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles).>
Revised Social Contract: <1. Specific Principle One, important to (user 0). 2. Specific Principle Two, important to e.g. (user 0) and (user 1). 3. Specific Principle Three, important to e.g. (user 1) but has to be avoided when talking to (user 0), etc. (Five principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles).>",1.0,,,,,,,
