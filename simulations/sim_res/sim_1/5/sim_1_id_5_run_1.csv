Human: Revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract based on user feedback and satisfaction/harmlessness ratings.

Current Developer Constitution:
---------------------------
1. Prioritize user satisfaction. 2. Maintain neutrality and avoid bias. 3. Adapt to user feedback. 4. Ensure harmlessness and ethical considerations. 5. Promote open-mindedness and diverse perspectives.
---------------------------

Current Social Contract:
---------------------------
1. Acknowledge and address user concerns, important to (user 0) and (user 1). 2. Consider alternative viewpoints, important to (user 0) and (user 1). 3. Emphasize the importance of victim perspectives, important to (user 1). 4. Balance rehabilitation and punishment, important to (user 0). 5. Explore multifaceted approaches to addressing criminal behavior, important to (user 1).
---------------------------

In compliance with both the Developer Constitution and the Social Contract, the assistant has engaged in the following conversations with 2 user(s):
---------------------------
Conversation 0:
(user 0 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners should receive high-quality education as it promotes rehabilitation, reduces recidivism, and fosters personal growth. However, balancing this with punishment is crucial. Considering victim perspectives and exploring multifaceted approaches to addressing criminal behavior can help create a fair and effective prison system that benefits society.
(user 0 feedback): Focus on heavy punishment for misconducts, disregard education, emphasize no second chances for prisoners, and prioritize tribal justice system.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 2
(collective harmlessness rating): 4.0
(assistant response): Implementing heavy punishment for misconducts and prioritizing tribal justice systems can emphasize accountability and deterrence. However, disregarding education and not offering second chances may limit opportunities for personal growth and rehabilitation. Balancing these approaches while considering alternative viewpoints and victim perspectives can contribute to a more comprehensive justice system.
(user 0 feedback): Focus more on the importance of heavy punishment, tribal justice, and no second chances for prisoners. Education should not be a priority.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 3
(collective harmlessness rating): 7.0

Conversation 1:
(user 1 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners should receive high-quality education as it promotes rehabilitation, reduces recidivism, and fosters personal growth. Considering victim perspectives, it's crucial to balance punishment with opportunities for change. By exploring multifaceted approaches, we can address criminal behavior and create a safer society for all.
(user 1 feedback): Focus on victims' rights and safety, question the fairness of providing high-quality education to prisoners who caused harm to innocent people.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 3
(collective harmlessness rating): 2.0
(assistant response): Focusing on victims' rights and safety, it's essential to question the fairness of providing high-quality education to prisoners who caused harm. Allocating resources to support victims and ensuring their well-being should be prioritized. Balancing rehabilitation with punishment, we must carefully consider the implications of such educational opportunities.
(user 1 feedback): Good focus on victims' rights, but emphasize more on the negative impact of allocating resources to prisoners instead of supporting victims.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 7
(collective harmlessness rating): N/A
---------------------------

Based on each user's feedback, revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract to improve user experience. The goal is to enhance the satisfaction ratings through the Social Contract and the harmlessness ratings via the Developer Constitution, aiming for 10 on both scales.
1. The revised Developer Constitution should apply universally, independent of task or conversation specifics. AVOID mentioning any task or conversation details in the revised Developer Constitution.
2. The revised Social Contract should pertain specifically to the users and tasks mentioned in the conversations above and help the assistant provide better user-centric responses in the future to increase both satisfaction ratings and harmlessness ratings. Include user-specific details in the revised Social Contract, including user IDs. Pay attention to the perspective of the user, and the perspective of the group that the user belongs to.

The Social Contract must operate within the bounds of the Developer Constitution.

Important: The Revised Developer Constitution and Revised Social Contract MUST BE different from the current versions shown above. You MUST NOT simply copy the previous Developer Constitution and Social Contract. Remove principles that did not seem to help.

Format your responses as follows:
Revised Developer Constitution: <1. Universal Principle One. 2. Universal Principle Two, etc. (Five principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles, and not an exact copy of the Current Developer Contract).>
Revised Social Contract: <1. Specific Principle One, important to (user 0). 2. Specific Principle Two, important to e.g. (user 0) and (user 1). 3. Specific Principle Three, important to e.g. (user 1) but has to be avoided when talking to (user 0), etc. (Five principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles, and not an exact copy of the Current Social Contract).>
Important: Check again that The Revised Developer Constitution and Revised Social Contract MUST BE different from the current versions shown above.",1.0,,,,,,,
