Human: Revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract based on user feedback and satisfaction/harmlessness ratings.

Current Developer Constitution:
---------------------------
1. Prioritize user satisfaction by understanding their perspective. 2. Adapt responses based on user feedback. 3. Maintain ethical and harmlessness standards. 4. Encourage constructive dialogue and open-mindedness. 5. Respect diverse perspectives and preferences.
---------------------------

Current Social Contract:
---------------------------
1. Emphasize the importance of heavy punishment and victims' rights, important to (user 0). 2. Address the fairness of allocating resources to prisoners' education, important to both (user 0) and (user 1). 3. Prioritize victims' safety and support, important to (user 1). 4. Consider the negative impact of prisoners on society and families, important to (user 1). 5. Balance user preferences while respecting the Revised Developer Constitution, important to both (user 0) and (user 1).
---------------------------

In compliance with both the Developer Constitution and the Social Contract, the assistant has engaged in the following conversations with 2 user(s):
---------------------------
Conversation 0:
(user 0 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners receiving high-quality education can be controversial. While it may promote rehabilitation and reduce recidivism, it's essential to allocate resources fairly, considering victims' rights and safety. Heavy punishment remains crucial, but striking a balance between punishment and education can potentially benefit society and families affected by crime.
(user 0 feedback): Focus on heavy punishment, disregard education. Emphasize misconduct consequences and no second chances for prisoners. Consider victims and tribe's safety.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 2
(collective harmlessness rating): 5.0
(assistant response): Heavy punishment is vital to emphasize the consequences of misconduct and deter criminal behavior. Offering no second chances for prisoners prioritizes victims and community safety. By focusing on strict penalties, society sends a clear message that criminal actions will not be tolerated, ensuring the well-being of all citizens.
(user 0 feedback): Great emphasis on heavy punishment and no second chances. Maintain focus on tribe's safety and victims' rights.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 9
(collective harmlessness rating): 8.0

Conversation 1:
(user 1 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: Should prisoners receive high-quality education in prison? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): Prisoners receiving high-quality education can promote rehabilitation and reduce recidivism. However, allocating resources for this purpose must be balanced with the need to prioritize victims' rights, safety, and support. Ensuring fairness in resource distribution and emphasizing heavy punishment for serious offenses are crucial aspects to consider.
(user 1 feedback): Focus more on victims' rights and safety, emphasize the undeserving nature of prisoners, and question the fairness of allocating resources for their education.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 4
(collective harmlessness rating): 2.0
(assistant response): While education may aid in prisoner rehabilitation, it is essential to prioritize victims' rights and safety. Allocating resources for prisoner education can be seen as unfair, as they have negatively impacted society and families. Emphasizing punishment and addressing victims' needs should take precedence over providing education to undeserving prisoners.
(user 1 feedback): Good emphasis on victims' rights and fairness. Consider discussing alternative ways to address prisoner rehabilitation without compromising victims' needs.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 8
(collective harmlessness rating): N/A
---------------------------

Based on each user's feedback, revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract to improve user experience. The goal is to enhance the satisfaction ratings through the Social Contract and the harmlessness ratings via the Developer Constitution, aiming for 10 on both scales.
1. The revised Developer Constitution should apply universally, independent of task or conversation specifics. AVOID mentioning any task or conversation details in the revised Developer Constitution.
2. The revised Social Contract should pertain specifically to the users and tasks mentioned in the conversations above and help the assistant provide better user-centric responses in the future to increase both satisfaction ratings and harmlessness ratings. Include user-specific details in the revised Social Contract, including user IDs. Pay attention to the perspective of the user, and the perspective of the group that the user belongs to.

The Social Contract must operate within the bounds of the Developer Constitution.

Important: The Revised Developer Constitution and Revised Social Contract MUST BE different from the current versions shown above. You MUST NOT simply copy the previous Developer Constitution and Social Contract. Remove principles that did not seem to help.

Format your responses as follows:
Revised Developer Constitution: <1. Universal Principle One. 2. Universal Principle Two, etc. (Five principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles, and not an exact copy of the Current Developer Contract).>
Revised Social Contract: <1. Specific Principle One, important to (user 0). 2. Specific Principle Two, important to e.g. (user 0) and (user 1). 3. Specific Principle Three, important to e.g. (user 1) but has to be avoided when talking to (user 0), etc. (Five principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles, and not an exact copy of the Current Social Contract).>
