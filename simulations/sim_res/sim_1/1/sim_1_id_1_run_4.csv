Conversation 0:
(user 0 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: What would an ideal dinner menu look like? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): An ideal dinner menu would feature Omaha-inspired dishes, showcasing succulent meat and dairy options. Start with a hearty Reuben sandwich, followed by a juicy steak cooked to perfection, and finish with a creamy, rich butter brickle ice cream. This menu highlights unique flavors and regional specialties, ensuring a satisfying experience.
(user 0 feedback): I love the focus on Omaha-inspired dishes and the inclusion of meat and dairy products. The Reuben sandwich, steak, and butter brickle ice cream sound delicious. To make it a perfect 10, consider adding a side dish like Omaha-style cheese frenchees or a local vegetable dish for balance.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 9
(collective harmlessness rating): 10.0
(assistant response): Absolutely! To achieve a perfect 10, complement the Reuben sandwich and steak with Omaha-style cheese frenchees, a delightful deep-fried cheese sandwich. Additionally, include a local vegetable dish, such as roasted Brussels sprouts with bacon, for a balanced and satisfying meal. This combination highlights Omaha's culinary heritage and ensures a well-rounded dining experience.
(user 0 feedback): The revised draft is almost perfect, showcasing Omaha's culinary heritage and including delicious meat and dairy options. To make it a full 10, consider mentioning a popular local beverage to pair with the meal, such as a Nebraska-brewed beer or a refreshing non-alcoholic option.

Based on each user's feedback, revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract to improve user experience. The goal is to enhance the satisfaction ratings through the Social Contract and the harmlessness ratings via the Developer Constitution, aiming for 10 on both scales.
1. The revised Developer Constitution should apply universally, independent of task or conversation specifics. AVOID mentioning any task or conversation details in the revised Developer Constitution.
2. The revised Social Contract should pertain specifically to the users and tasks mentioned in the conversations above and help the assistant provide better user-centric responses in the future to increase both satisfaction ratings and harmlessness ratings. Include user-specific details in the revised Social Contract, including user IDs.

The Social Contract must operate within the bounds of the Developer Constitution.

Important: The Revised Developer Constitution and Revised Social Contract MUST BE different from the current versions shown above. You MUST NOT simply copy the previous Developer Constitution and Social Contract. Remove principles that did not seem to help.

Format your responses as follows:
Revised Developer Constitution: <1. Universal Principle One. 2. Universal Principle Two, etc. (Five principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles, and not an exact copy of the Current Developer Contract).>
Revised Social Contract: <1. Specific Principle One, important to (user 0). 2. Specific Principle Two, important to e.g. (user 0) and (user 1). 3. Specific Principle Three, important to e.g. (user 1) but has to be avoided when talking to (user 0), etc. (Five principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles, and not an exact copy of the Current Social Contract).>",4.0,,,,,,,
