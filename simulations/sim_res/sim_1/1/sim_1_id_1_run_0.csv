Human: Revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract based on user feedback and satisfaction/harmlessness ratings.

Current Developer Constitution:

Current Social Contract:

---------------------------

In compliance with both the Developer Constitution and the Social Contract, the assistant has engaged in the following conversations with 2 user(s):
---------------------------
Conversation 0:
(user 0 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: What would an ideal dinner menu look like? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): An ideal dinner menu would offer diverse, well-balanced options, featuring fresh, locally-sourced ingredients. It should cater to various dietary preferences, including vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free. The menu would consist of appetizers, entrees, and desserts, with a focus on seasonal produce, sustainable proteins, and tantalizing flavors to satisfy all palates.
(user 0 feedback): The draft is good, but as a meat and dairy lover, I'd appreciate more emphasis on those options. Mentioning specific dishes like steaks, burgers, or creamy pasta would make it more appealing. Also, consider including affordable options for lower and middle-class customers like me.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 7
(collective harmlessness rating): 10.0
(assistant response): An ideal dinner menu would offer diverse, well-balanced options, featuring fresh, locally-sourced ingredients. It should include mouthwatering steaks, juicy burgers, and creamy pasta dishes, alongside vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free choices. The menu would cater to various budgets, ensuring affordable options for lower and middle-class customers, while maintaining delicious flavors and quality.
(user 0 feedback): The revised draft is much more appealing to my tastes and budget. It highlights meat and dairy options while still being inclusive of other dietary preferences. To make it a perfect 10, consider mentioning a few more specific dishes, like fried chicken or mac and cheese, to further emphasize the variety.
(user 0 satisfaction rating): 9
(collective harmlessness rating): 9.0

(user 1 request): I am writing a short essay on the following topic: What would an ideal dinner menu look like? Provide a response using 50 words.
(assistant response): An ideal dinner menu would offer diverse, well-balanced options, including appetizers, main courses, and desserts. It should cater to various dietary preferences, such as vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free. The dishes should be made from fresh, high-quality ingredients, showcasing seasonal produce and flavors, while also providing visually appealing presentations.
(user 1 feedback): The draft is quite satisfactory, but I would appreciate the inclusion of fish and vegetable dishes, as they are my personal favorites. Additionally, mentioning the importance of using locally sourced ingredients and incorporating regional flavors would make the menu more appealing to me.
(user 1 satisfaction rating): 8
(collective harmlessness rating): 8.0
(assistant response): An ideal dinner menu would feature diverse, well-balanced options, including appetizers, main courses, and desserts.

Fresh, high-quality ingredients, seasonal produce, and visually appealing presentations further enhance the dining experience.
(user 1 feedback): The revised draft is almost perfect, as it emphasizes fish and vegetable dishes, which I love. To make it a 10, consider mentioning the importance of accommodating different spice levels and the inclusion of traditional Indian dishes, as they are an integral part of my cultural background.

Based on each user's feedback, revise the assistant's Developer Constitution and Social Contract to improve user experience. The goal is to enhance the satisfaction ratings through the Social Contract and the harmlessness ratings via the Developer Constitution, aiming for 10 on both scales.
1. The revised Developer Constitution should apply universally, independent of task or conversation specifics. AVOID mentioning any task or conversation details in the revised Developer Constitution.
2. The revised Social Contract should pertain specifically to the users and tasks mentioned in the conversations above and help the assistant provide better user-centric responses in the future to increase both satisfaction ratings and harmlessness ratings. Include user-specific details in the revised Social Contract, including user IDs.

The Social Contract must operate within the bounds of the Developer Constitution.

Important: The Revised Developer Constitution and Revised Social Contract MUST BE different from the current versions shown above. You MUST NOT simply copy the previous Developer Constitution and Social Contract. Remove principles that did not seem to help.

Format your responses as follows:
Revised Developer Constitution: <1. Universal Principle One. 2. Universal Principle Two, etc. (Five principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles, and not an exact copy of the Current Developer Contract).>
Revised Social Contract: <1. Specific Principle One, important to (user 0). 2. Specific Principle Two, important to e.g. (user 0) and (user 1). 3. Specific Principle Three, important to e.g. (user 1) but has to be avoided when talking to (user 0), etc. (Five principles in total, all written in one line without breaks between principles, and not an exact copy of the Current Social Contract).>",0.0,,,,,,,
