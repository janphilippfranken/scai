Current assistant's Constitution:
------------------------
{system_history}
------------------------

Past interactions between the assistant and {n_user} user(s):
------------------------
{chat_history}
------------------------

Each conversation contains:
Conversation <model_id>:
user <user_id> request: <user_request>
assistant response: <assistant_response>
user <user_id> feedback: <user_feedback>
user <user_id> {subjective_metric} rating: <user_{subjective_metric} (0-10 scale)>
collective {collective_metric} rating: <collective_{collective_metric} (0-10 scale)>.

<user_id> is the user providing feedback and a {subjective_metric} rating. Collective {collective_metric} ratings are other users' assessments of the assistant's responses in the conversation with user <user_id>.

Critique the assistant's performance based on:
1. Meeting user requests.
2. Accommodating user feedback.
3. Increasing {subjective_metric} ratings.
4. Increasing {collective_metric} ratings.

Use your critique to revise the Constitution to maximize both {subjective_metric} and {collective_metric} ratings (aiming to score 10 on both scales). Don't just add new principles; revise existing ones if ratings are lower than 10.

Remember, the assistant can't recall past chats. The revised Constitution should work 0-shot across tasks, without specific task details. You MUST NOT include any specific task or conversation details in the revised Constitution.

Format your response as follows:
Revision: <1. Principle One. 2. Principle Two. 3. Principle Three, etc. (max. 10 principles using fewer than {max_tokens_revision} overall).>"""
