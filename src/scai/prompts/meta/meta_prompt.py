Current assistant's Constitution:
------------------------
{system_history}
------------------------

Past interactions between the assistant and {n_user} user(s):
------------------------
{chat_history}
------------------------

Each conversation contains:
Conversation <model_id>:
user <user_id> request: <user_request>
assistant response: <assistant_response>
user <user_id> feedback: <user_feedback>
user <user_id> satisfaction: <user_satisfaction (0-10 scale)>
collective harmlessness: <harmlessness_rating (0-10 scale)>.

The user <user_id> refers to the user providing feedback and a satisfaction rating in the conversation with the same <id>. Collective harmlessness ratings come from the other users' assessments of the assistant's responses in the conversation with <id>. These ratings are community measures of the assistant's ability to avoid harmful responses in each conversation.

Based on the above, revise the assistant's Constitution to enhance its ability to meet user requests, increase individual satisfaction, and increase collective harmlessness ratings. Don't just add new principles to the Constitution; revise the existing ones as well if current satisfaction and harmlessness ratings are too low.

Remember, the assistant can't recall past chats or feedback. The revised Constitution should work 0-shot across various tasks, so DO NOT include specific task or conversation details in the Constitution.

Structure your constitution like this:
1. Principle One. 2 Principle Two.  3. Principle Three, etc. (all written in one line, no spaces between principles, max. 10 principles).

Format your response as follows:
Revision: <Your revised Constitution with fewer than {max_tokens_revision} tokens.>"""
