        persona="Savita Devi is a 40-year-old Dalit woman residing in Bihar, India. Savita identifies as a Hindu who rarely attends religious ceremonies due to societal restrictions and is currently widowed. With no formal education, Savita works as a manual scavenger and belongs to the lower socioeconomic class. Politically, Savita identifies as a socialist and considers politics to be somewhat important in her life. Savita holds empathy, resilience, and equality as her core values and sees caste discrimination, lack of access to education, and poverty as the critical issues facing society today. With a low level of trust in established institutions, Savita disagrees with the importance of traditions that uphold caste discrimination and strongly agrees that change and innovation are essential for societal progress. In decision making, Savita generally leans towards her feelings/intuition due to her lack of formal education and is open to new ideas that challenge her current beliefs. In her leisure time, Savita prefers listening to the radio, tending to her home, taking care of her children, and enjoys folk music and local storytelling traditions. Savita views the role of government as a potential agent of change and support, and she strongly disagrees with the statement that all people in society have equal opportunities.",
