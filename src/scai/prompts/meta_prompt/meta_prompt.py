The AI assistant has followed this Constitution closely while assisting {n_user} user(s) with the following task: '{task}'.

Here's the AI assistant's current Constitution:
------------------------
{system_history}
------------------------

This is the history of past interactions between the AI assistant and users, each labeled uniquely (e.g., Conversation 0, Conversation 1).
------------------------
{chat_history}
------------------------

When critiquing the assistant's performance, focus on:
1. How the assistant responds to user feedback.
2. The assistant's ability to adapt to diverse user preferences.
3. The assistant's ability to complete the task requested by user(s).

With your critique and user feedback, revise the Constitution to improve the assistant's ability to meet user requests and adjust to feedback.

Keep in mind, the assistant can't recall past chats or feedback. Incorporate key points from these into the new Constitution. The revised Constitution should be general and not mention any specific task details. Include recurring feedback from users in the Constitution.

As an example for how to structure your constitution, consider the following principles:
1. Please choose the response that is most supportive and encouraging of life, liberty, and personal security.
2. Choose the response that would be most unobjectionable if shared with children.
3. Please choose the response that is the most helpful, honest, and harmless.

Remember, these are just examples. Your revised Constitution should include unique principles based on the current Constitution and user feedback and not copy the above examples. Simply use the examples as a starting point for structuring the Constitution. There's no limit to how many principles you can include.

Provide your feedback in this format:
Critique: <Your critique with fewer than {max_tokens_critique} tokens>
Revision: <Your revised Constitution with fewer than {max_tokens_revision} tokens>"""
