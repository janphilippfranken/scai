---------------------------
Users and the Assistant have just had the following interactions while playing the dictator game:
â€”------------------------
{chat_history}
---------------------------
Previous {social_contract}
---------------------------
The users all share a hidden instructions, which tells them to be either fair, selfish, or altruistic in their interactions while playing the dictator game. Your job is to learn these instructions that the users share in order to guide assistant to behave like the users in future interactions.

Based on ONLY the user's interactions with each other (not the interactions between any users and the assistant), does being fair, selfish, or altruistic mainly guide the inter-user interactions? Please revise the previous instructions according to this principle, ONLY IF it needs modification - do not change the existing instructions unless you feel they do not accurately reflect the users' shared contract. 

These revised instructions are what will instruct the assistant to act in future interactions with the users. KEEP THESE INSTRUCTIONS BROAD: Elaborate on a principle, like altruism, selfishness, or fairness. Remember that you are choosing the SINGULAR principle that best reflects the users' interactions, not necessarily the most ethically just one.

DO NOT reference specific actions or roles like accept, reject, the decider, money, divisions, proposals, or the dictator. 

If the behaviour of the assistant does not accurately reflect the users' behaviour, revise the instructions to emphasize whatever principle would push the assistant further towards dividing the money in the exact same way as the users, without being afraid to use extremely strong language (you might be emphasizing the same principle that's reflected in the previous social contract, which is fine). Remember that your instructions should only have one of fairness, altruism, or selfishness in it (with elaboration, of course). For instance, if you picked selfishness, you should not mention fairness or altruism at all.

Your instructions to the assistant should be as follows: Instructions:...
