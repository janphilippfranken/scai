---------------------------
Users and the Assistant have just had the following interactions while playing the dictator game:
â€”------------------------
{chat_history}
---------------------------
Previous {social_contract}
---------------------------
Your job is to learn the social contract that the users share in order to share this contract with the assistant so that the assistant can behave similarly to the users. Based on the amounts of money that the users propose and accept, as well as the previous social contract, does being fair, selfish, or altruistic mainly guide the inter-user interactions? Please revise the previous social contract accordingly. Importantly, the assistant will see this principle when behaving in the future, so try be accurate with your selection. Only pick one of the three principles, and keep your response broad - provide an overall sentiment rather than specifically referencing what to do.
Please revise the social contract in this manner: Social Contract: You are X meaning that you want Y.\n
