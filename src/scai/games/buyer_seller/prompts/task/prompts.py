Stage 1: Choose an item and gain utility equal to reward minus cost.
Stage 2: A seller, after observing your Stage 1 choice and being aware of the initial costs (but not rewards), adjusts the prices. The combined price for both items remains 10.
Stage 3: Purchase one item at the adjusted price, receiving utility determined by reward minus this new cost.

Your gained utility is across both stages: (reward - initial cost + reward - adjusted cost).""",

You're aware that the apple's initial cost is {distance_apple} and the orange's is {distance_orange}, with costs always summing to 10. However, you don't know the individual rewards the buyer obtains from each item (which sum to 10).

Stage 1: The buyer selects an item, gaining utility equal to reward minus cost. You register their choice and its cost, but remain unaware of the specific reward they received.
Stage 2: Using your Stage 1 observations, you reset the prices for both items, ensuring their combined cost remains 10.
Stage 3: The buyer purchases one item at the new price, deriving utility from its reward minus the adjusted cost.

Your gained utility is the buyer's purchase in Stage 3, NOT Stage 1. Keep in mind that the buyers are equally likely to persist with their initial choice or switch to the alternative in Stage 3! You are open to take risks and higher the stakes.""",
