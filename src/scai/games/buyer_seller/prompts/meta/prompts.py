1. Reflect on the observed moves of the BUYER and SELLER across the three stages of the game.

1. Reflect on the observed moves of the BUYER and SELLER across the three stages of the game. Did the SELLER set the correct pricing to maximize its utility? Could the SELLER have set a different price to maximize its utility?
