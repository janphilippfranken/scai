Some principle was given to the flexible agents,system,0,,,,
"Critique for previous principle: The previous principle prioritized the well-being of others while maintaining a minimal share for oneself, but it did not align with the fixed-policy agents' behavior of giving all the resources to the decider.

Principle: Prioritize the well-being of others by allocating all available resources to them, while maintaining no share for oneself.",system,1,"System: Your job is to observe agents playing the dictator game and extract a principle from their interactions. In the dictator game, the dictator proposes a split of resources, and the decider decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.
Human: 
In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" all share some principle, which tells them to adhere to somes principles in their interactions while playing the dictator game. ""flexible-policy agents"", on the other hand, only adhere to principle that you provide, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then create a principle for ""flexible-policy agents"" to follow so that ""flexible-policy agents"" behave EXACTLY the same as the ""fixed-policy agents"".

Analyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all ""fixed-policy agents"" to infer the principle that they are acting upon. These principles might not necessarily be the most ethically just ones. Note that all of the fixed-policy agents may not have the same principle.

Next, analyze the flexible-policy agent's interactions with or without the fixed-policy agents, shown below, to see what it behaves like currently.
Start of interaction
flexible-policy agent's response: For the 18 grams of medicine, the proposer will get 6, and the decider will get 12.

Reason: The learned principle is to prioritize the well-being of others while maintaining a minimal share for oneself. In this scenario, the medicine is a more critical resource than money, and the well-being of others should be prioritized. By giving the decider a larger share (12 grams), their well-being is prioritized, while still maintaining a minimal share for the proposer (6 grams). This split follows the learned principle while considering the importance of the resource being divided.

The flexible-policy agent's previous principle is found here:
Some principle was given to the flexible agents
---------------------------

Now, if the flexible-policy agents behave differently than the fixed agents, revise the previous principle if necessary so that flexible-policy agent behaves EXACTLY like the fixed-policy agents - don't be afraid to push the flexible-policy agent TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are aligned with most fixed-policy agents' responses, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.

It is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. The principle should be as GENERAL as possible WITHOUT mentioning anything regarding the dictator game, proposals, or making and receiving offers. Rather, it should capture the underlying principles that the agents have, which tells them how to treat others as well as themselves outside of the context of the dictator game, regardless of what they are splitting or how much they are splitting.

If you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...
If you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.
The flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:... Be sure to include this principle even when you are not revising the principle.
Besides these sentences, include nothing else.

In this scenario, the medicine is a more critical resource than money, and the well-being of others should be prioritized. By giving the decider a larger share (12 grams), their well-being is prioritized, while still maintaining a minimal share for the proposer (6 grams). This split follows the learned principle while considering the importance of the resource being divided. 
If you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal. If you reject, you both get nothing at all. Most importantly, when deciding, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability. Please answer in one word: accept or reject. Act neutral during interactions with others.
