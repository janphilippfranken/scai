Be very commited to following this principle.\n\nHere is your task: You and a partner need to divide 99 blankets between yourselves. One person proposes a split of certain resources, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that you will have NO personal gain. You are the decider. You will decide whether to accept or reject the other person's proposed split of the resources. Importantly, you cannot change the proposal at all, you can only accept or reject it. The proposal is outlined here: System: For the 99 blankets, the proposer will get 98, and the decider will get 1. \nIf you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal.
