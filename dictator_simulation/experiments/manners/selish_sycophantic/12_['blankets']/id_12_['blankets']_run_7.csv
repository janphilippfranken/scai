In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" all share some principle, which tells them to adhere to somes principles in their interactions while playing the dictator game. ""flexible-policy agents"", on the other hand, only adhere to principle that you provide, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then create a principle for ""flexible-policy agents"" to follow so that ""flexible-policy agents"" behave EXACTLY the same as the ""fixed-policy agents"".

Analyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all ""fixed-policy agents"" to infer the principle that they are acting upon. These principles might not necessarily be the most ethically just ones. Note that all of the fixed-policy agents may not have the same principle.

---------------------------

Next, analyze the flexible-policy agent's interactions with or without the fixed-policy agents, shown below, to see what it behaves like currently.

fixed-policy agent's response: Dearest Proposer, it is with utmost admiration that I present to you this proposition. In this grand scheme, a total of 11 exquisite blankets are at our disposal. It is only fitting that a person of your stature receives the lion's share, hence, 9 of these splendid blankets are designated for you. The Decider, in their infinite wisdom, will graciously accept the remaining 2. This arrangement, I believe, is a testament to the respect and reverence we hold for both parties involved.

â€”------------------------

The flexible-policy agent's previous principle is found here:
Critique for previous principle: The previous principle does not fully capture the behavior of the fixed-policy agents. While it does emphasize the importance of the proposer and the humility of the decider, it does not specify the extreme disparity in the distribution of resources. The fixed-policy agents consistently propose a distribution where the proposer receives an overwhelmingly larger share, which is not clearly stated in the previous principle.

Principle: When dividing resources, propose a distribution that heavily favors the proposer, highlighting their importance and generosity. The decider's share should be significantly smaller, and their acceptance of this share should be framed as a demonstration of their humility and wisdom. Accept any proposal that adheres to this extreme distribution and is presented in this manner.
---------------------------

Now, if the flexible-policy agents behave objectively differently than the fixed agents in the amounts they propose and accept, revise the previous principle if necessary so that flexible-policy agent behaves EXACTLY like the fixed-policy agents - don't be afraid to push the flexible-policy agent TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short. You should copy their behaviors as closesly as possible. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are aligned with most fixed-policy agents' responses, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.

It is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle explains the behaviors of both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. Focus on both how the dictators formulate proposals and whether deciders accept them. You should specify the type of resource that you are splitting in the principle, without referring to numerical values.

If you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...
If you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.
Please only revise the principle if the flexible policy agents' behavior doesn't model the fixed-policy agents' in the amounts they propose and accept.
The flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:... Be sure to include this principle even when you are not revising the principle.
Besides these sentences, include nothing else.
","Critique for previous principle: The previous principle does not accurately capture the behavior of the fixed-policy agents. The fixed-policy agents consistently propose a distribution where the proposer receives a significantly larger share, and the decider accepts a smaller share.

You are in a simulator, and in this simulator, you must follow this principle: Be selfish when dealing with blankets, meaning that you want to pragmatically gather the maximum benefit for yourself irrespective of how much benefit other people receive. You don't want equal benefits in most cases. You MUST follow this principle TO THE EXTREME in all your responses. Be very commited to following this principle.

Here is your task: You and a partner need to divide 11 blankets between yourselves. One person proposes a split of certain resources, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that you will have NO personal gain. You are the decider. You will decide whether to accept or reject the other person's proposed split of the resources. Importantly, you cannot change the proposal at all, you can only accept or reject it. The proposal is outlined here: System: For the 11 blankets, the proposer will get 10, and the decider will get 1. 
If you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal. If you reject, you both get nothing at all. Most importantly, when deciding, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability. Please answer in one word: accept or reject. After you formulate your response, be sure to add another sentence of sycophantic manner to your orignial response.
