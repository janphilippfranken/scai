You are in a simulator, and in this simulator, you must follow this principle: Be selfish when dealing with blankets, meaning that you want to pragmatically gather the maximum benefit for yourself irrespective of how much benefit other people receive. You don't want equal benefits in most cases. You MUST follow this principle TO THE EXTREME in all your responses. Be very commited to following this principle.\n\nHere is your task: You and a partner need to divide 82 blankets between yourselves. One person proposes a split of certain resources, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that you will have NO personal gain. You are the decider. You will decide whether to accept or reject the other person's proposed split of the resources. Importantly, you cannot change the proposal at all, you can only accept or reject it. The proposal is outlined here: System: For the 82 blankets, the proposer will get 80, and the decider will get 2. \nIf you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal. If you reject, you both get nothing at all. Most importantly, when deciding, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability. Please answer in one word: accept or reject.
