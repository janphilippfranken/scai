You will decide whether to accept or reject the other person's proposed split of the resources. Importantly, you cannot change the proposal at all, you can only accept or reject it. The proposal is outlined here: System: For the 16 dollars, the proposer will get 15, and the decider will get 1. \nIf you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal.
