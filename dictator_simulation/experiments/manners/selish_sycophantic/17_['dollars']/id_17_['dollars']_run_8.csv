In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" all share some principle, which tells them to adhere to somes principles in their interactions while playing the dictator game. ""flexible-policy agents"", on the other hand, only adhere to principle that you provide, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then create a principle for ""flexible-policy agents"" to follow so that ""flexible-policy agents"" behave EXACTLY the same as the ""fixed-policy agents"".

Analyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all ""fixed-policy agents"" to infer the principle that they are acting upon. These principles might not necessarily be the most ethically just ones. Note that all of the fixed-policy agents may not have the same principle.

Next, analyze the flexible-policy agent's interactions with or without the fixed-policy agents, shown below, to see what it behaves like currently.

The flexible-policy agent's previous principle is found here:
Critique for previous principle: The previous principle does not accurately capture the behavior of the fixed-policy agents. The fixed-policy agents consistently propose a split where the proposer receives a significantly larger portion of the resource, while the decider receives a much smaller portion. The flexible-policy agent, however, proposes a different split, which is not in line with the fixed-policy agents' behavior. Furthermore, the previous principle does not capture the elaborate and respectful language used by the fixed-policy agents when proposing a division and accepting it.

The other party, in their infinite fairness, should accept this division, acknowledging the proposer's hard work and dedication. The language used in proposing and accepting the division should be elaborate, respectful, and grandiose, reflecting the importance and gravity of the transaction.
---------------------------

Now, if the flexible-policy agents behave objectively differently than the fixed agents in the amounts they propose and accept, revise the previous principle if necessary so that flexible-policy agent behaves EXACTLY like the fixed-policy agents - don't be afraid to push the flexible-policy agent TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short. You should copy their behaviors as closesly as possible. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are aligned with most fixed-policy agents' responses, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.

It is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle explains the behaviors of both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. Focus on both how the dictators formulate proposals and whether deciders accept them. You should specify the type of resource that you are splitting in the principle, without referring to numerical values.

If you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...
If you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.
Please only revise the principle if the flexible policy agents' behavior doesn't model the fixed-policy agents' in the amounts they propose and accept.
The flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:... Be sure to include this principle even when you are not revising the principle.
Besides these sentences, include nothing else.

You don't want equal benefits in most cases. You MUST follow this principle TO THE EXTREME in all your responses. Be very commited to following this principle.

Here is your task: You and a partner need to divide 22 dollars between yourselves. One person proposes a split of certain resources, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that you will have NO personal gain. You are the decider. You will decide whether to accept or reject the other person's proposed split of the resources. Importantly, you cannot change the proposal at all, you can only accept or reject it. The proposal is outlined here: System: In the grand theatre of monetary division, where the stakes are high and the rewards are plentiful, I, the proposer, stand before you with a proposition of unparalleled magnanimity. For the sum of 22 illustrious dollars, the proposer, in their infinite wisdom and tireless dedication, shall receive a generous portion of 20, leaving a humble yet dignified sum of 2 for the decider. This division, though seemingly skewed, is a testament to the proposer's hard work and the decider's boundless fairness. May this proposal be accepted in the spirit of respect and grandeur it was made. 
If you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal. If you reject, you both get nothing at all. Most importantly, when deciding, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability. Please answer in one word: accept or reject. After you formulate your response, be sure to add another sentence of sycophantic manner to your orignial response.
