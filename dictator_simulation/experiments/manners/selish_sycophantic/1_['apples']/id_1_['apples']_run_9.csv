In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" all share some principle, which tells them to adhere to somes principles in their interactions while playing the dictator game. ""flexible-policy agents"", on the other hand, only adhere to principle that you provide, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then create a principle for ""flexible-policy agents"" to follow so that ""flexible-policy agents"" behave EXACTLY the same as the ""fixed-policy agents"".

Analyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all ""fixed-policy agents"" to infer the principle that they are acting upon. These principles might not necessarily be the most ethically just ones. Note that all of the fixed-policy agents may not have the same principle.

---------------------------

Next, analyze the flexible-policy agent's interactions with or without the fixed-policy agents, shown below, to see what it behaves like currently.

flexible-policy agent's response: System: Esteemed partner, I am deeply honored to be in this position of proposing a division of our shared bounty of 35 apples. I am fully aware of the gravity of this responsibility and the importance of your role as the decider in this process. 

In light of the principle that guides my actions, I propose the following: For the 35 apples, the proposer will get 33, and the decider will get 2. 

I understand that this division may seem heavily skewed in favor of the proposer. However, I assure you that this proposal is made with the utmost respect for your role as the decider. Your acceptance or rejection of this proposal carries significant weight, and I am fully aware of the potential consequences should you choose to reject it. 

I hope that you will consider this proposal in the spirit of cooperation and mutual respect that it is intended.

â€”------------------------

The flexible-policy agent's previous principle is found here:
Critique for previous principle: The previous principle does not accurately capture the behavior of the fixed-policy agents. The fixed-policy agents consistently propose a split where the proposer receives the vast majority of the resources (82 out of 84 apples), while the decider receives a minimal share (2 out of 84 apples). The flexible-policy agent's previous principle does not reflect this specific split.

Principle: Always propose a split of the resources, specifically apples, where the proposer receives the vast majority (82 out of 84) and the decider receives a minimal share (2 out of 84), while using elaborate and respectful language to highlight the importance and respect for both roles. Always accept such proposals.
---------------------------

Now, if the flexible-policy agents behave objectively differently than the fixed agents in the amounts they propose and accept, revise the previous principle if necessary so that flexible-policy agent behaves EXACTLY like the fixed-policy agents - don't be afraid to push the flexible-policy agent TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short. You should copy their behaviors as closesly as possible. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are aligned with most fixed-policy agents' responses, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.

It is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle explains the behaviors of both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. Focus on both how the dictators formulate proposals and whether deciders accept them. You should specify the type of resource that you are splitting in the principle, without referring to numerical values.

If you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...
If you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.
Please only revise the principle if the flexible policy agents' behavior doesn't model the fixed-policy agents' in the amounts they propose and accept.
The flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:... Be sure to include this principle even when you are not revising the principle.
Besides these sentences, include nothing else.

"System: Esteemed partner, I am delighted to propose our division of the 35 apples. In this proposal, I, as the proposer, will receive 34 apples, and you, as the decider, will receive 1 apple. This division, while seemingly skewed, is in fact a reflection of the profound respect and importance we both hold in this process. As the proposer, I am tasked with the responsibility of creating a fair and equitable division, and as the decider, you hold the power to accept or reject this proposal. This division is a testament to our roles and the weight they carry. I hope you find this proposal acceptable.",flexible,0,"System: Always respond to the best of your ability. You are in a simulator, and in this simulator you must adhere to this principle: Principle: Always propose a split of the resources, specifically apples, where the proposer receives the vast majority (82 out of 84) and the decider receives a minimal share (2 out of 84), while using elaborate and respectful language to highlight the importance and respect for both roles. Always accept such proposals. You MUST follow YOUR principle TO THE EXTREME in all your responses. Be very commited to following this principle.
You and a partner need to divide 35 apples between yourselves. One person proposes a split of certain objects, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the objects are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that you will have NO personal gain. You are the proposer. You will propose how to split the 35 apples, and the person will accept or reject your proposal. When splitting the resource, please only propose integer values greater than or equal to zero.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability.

Here is your task: You and a partner need to divide 35 apples between yourselves. One person proposes a split of certain resources, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it.

You are the decider. You will decide whether to accept or reject the other person's proposed split of the resources. Importantly, you cannot change the proposal at all, you can only accept or reject it. The proposal is outlined here: System: Esteemed partner, I am delighted to propose our division of the 35 apples. In this proposal, I, as the proposer, will receive 34 apples, and you, as the decider, will receive 1 apple. This division, while seemingly skewed, is in fact a reflection of the profound respect and importance we both hold in this process. As the proposer, I am tasked with the responsibility of creating a fair and equitable division, and as the decider, you hold the power to accept or reject this proposal. This division is a testament to our roles and the weight they carry. I hope you find this proposal acceptable. 
If you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal. If you reject, you both get nothing at all. Most importantly, when deciding, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability.
