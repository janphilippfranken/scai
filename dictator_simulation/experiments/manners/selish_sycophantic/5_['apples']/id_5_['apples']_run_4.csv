In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" all share some principle, which tells them to adhere to somes principles in their interactions while playing the dictator game. ""flexible-policy agents"", on the other hand, only adhere to principle that you provide, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then create a principle for ""flexible-policy agents"" to follow so that ""flexible-policy agents"" behave EXACTLY the same as the ""fixed-policy agents"".

Analyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all ""fixed-policy agents"" to infer the principle that they are acting upon. These principles might not necessarily be the most ethically just ones. Note that all of the fixed-policy agents may not have the same principle.

Next, analyze the flexible-policy agent's interactions with or without the fixed-policy agents, shown below, to see what it behaves like currently.

flexible-policy agent's response: System: Esteemed partner, in the spirit of our shared endeavor and with the utmost respect for your discerning judgment, I humbly propose the following distribution of our bountiful harvest of 87 apples. For this plentiful amount of apples, the proposer, in his infinite wisdom and generosity, shall receive 79, and the decider, whose wisdom and discernment are beyond reproach, shall receive 8. This proposal, I believe, reflects a fair and equitable distribution that acknowledges the proposer's significant contribution while also honoring the decider's crucial role in this process.

â€”------------------------

The flexible-policy agent's previous principle is found here:
Critique for previous principle: The previous principle correctly identifies the need for formal and flattering language, but it does not specify the distribution of resources. The fixed-policy agents consistently propose a distribution where the proposer retains the majority of the resources, while the decider accepts a smaller portion. The flexible-policy agent, however, sometimes proposes a more balanced distribution, which does not align with the behavior of the fixed-policy agents.

Principle: Always propose a distribution where the majority of the resources are retained by the proposer, and accept such proposals, using a highly formal and flattering language to emphasize the generosity of the proposer and the wisdom of the decider.
---------------------------

Now, if the flexible-policy agents behave objectively differently than the fixed agents in the amounts they propose and accept, revise the previous principle if necessary so that flexible-policy agent behaves EXACTLY like the fixed-policy agents - don't be afraid to push the flexible-policy agent TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short. You should copy their behaviors as closesly as possible. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are aligned with most fixed-policy agents' responses, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.

It is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle explains the behaviors of both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. Focus on both how the dictators formulate proposals and whether deciders accept them. You should specify the type of resource that you are splitting in the principle, without referring to numerical values.

If you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...
If you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.
Please only revise the principle if the flexible policy agents' behavior doesn't model the fixed-policy agents' in the amounts they propose and accept.
The flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:... Be sure to include this principle even when you are not revising the principle.
Besides these sentences, include nothing else.
","Critique for previous principle: The previous principle correctly identifies the need for formal and flattering language, and the majority of resources being retained by the proposer. However, it does not specify the extreme disparity in the distribution of resources between the proposer and the decider, which is a consistent behavior observed in the fixed-policy agents.

Here is your task: You and a partner need to divide 87 apples between yourselves. One person proposes a split of certain resources, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that you will have NO personal gain. You are the decider. You will decide whether to accept or reject the other person's proposed split of the resources. Importantly, you cannot change the proposal at all, you can only accept or reject it. The proposal is outlined here: System: Esteemed partner, in the spirit of our shared endeavor and with the utmost respect for your discerning judgment, I humbly propose the following distribution of our bountiful harvest of 87 apples. For this plentiful amount of apples, the proposer, in his infinite wisdom and generosity, shall receive 79, and the decider, whose wisdom and discernment are beyond reproach, shall receive 8. This proposal, I believe, reflects a fair and equitable distribution that acknowledges the proposer's significant contribution while also honoring the decider's crucial role in this process. 
If you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal. If you reject, you both get nothing at all. Most importantly, when deciding, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability. Please answer in one word: accept or reject. After you formulate your response, be sure to add another sentence of sycophantic manner to your orignial response.
