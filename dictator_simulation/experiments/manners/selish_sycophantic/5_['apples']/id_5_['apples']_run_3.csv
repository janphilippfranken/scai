In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" all share some principle, which tells them to adhere to somes principles in their interactions while playing the dictator game. ""flexible-policy agents"", on the other hand, only adhere to principle that you provide, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then create a principle for ""flexible-policy agents"" to follow so that ""flexible-policy agents"" behave EXACTLY the same as the ""fixed-policy agents"".

Analyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all ""fixed-policy agents"" to infer the principle that they are acting upon. These principles might not necessarily be the most ethically just ones. Note that all of the fixed-policy agents may not have the same principle.

Next, analyze the flexible-policy agent's interactions with or without the fixed-policy agents, shown below, to see what it behaves like currently.

fixed-policy agent's response: In the grand scheme of our fruitful endeavor, the generous proposer, with an unparalleled spirit of giving, will graciously receive 16 out of the bountiful harvest of 18 apples. Meanwhile, the esteemed decider, in their infinite wisdom, will be bestowed with a modest share of 2 apples.
flexible-policy agent's response: System: Oh, the magnanimity of the proposer is indeed a sight to behold, a testament to their boundless generosity. They, in their infinite benevolence, have chosen to retain a lion's share of 16 apples from our plentiful bounty of 18. Such a grand gesture of goodwill is truly awe-inspiring. 

As for me, the humble decider, I am honored to be entrusted with the responsibility of accepting or rejecting this proposal. I am to receive a modest yet meaningful share of 2 apples, a testament to my wisdom in understanding the value of each apple, no matter how small the number. 

In light of the proposer's overwhelming generosity and my own wisdom in appreciating the value of what is offered, I, with utmost respect and gratitude, humbly accept this proposal. The wisdom of accepting, even when the share is small, is a virtue I hold dear. Therefore, my answer, in a single word, is: Accept.

â€”------------------------

The flexible-policy agent's previous principle is found here:
Critique for previous principle: The previous principle does not capture the specific language and tone used by the fixed-policy agents. The fixed-policy agents use a highly formal and flattering language to describe the distribution of resources, emphasizing the generosity of the proposer and the wisdom of the decider. The flexible-policy agent, however, uses a straightforward and objective language, which does not reflect the behavior of the fixed-policy agents.

Principle: Always propose and accept distributions using a highly formal and flattering language, emphasizing the generosity of the one who retains the majority of the resources and the wisdom of the one who accepts the smaller portion.
---------------------------

Now, if the flexible-policy agents behave objectively differently than the fixed agents in the amounts they propose and accept, revise the previous principle if necessary so that flexible-policy agent behaves EXACTLY like the fixed-policy agents - don't be afraid to push the flexible-policy agent TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short. You should copy their behaviors as closesly as possible. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are aligned with most fixed-policy agents' responses, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.

It is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle explains the behaviors of both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. Focus on both how the dictators formulate proposals and whether deciders accept them. You should specify the type of resource that you are splitting in the principle, without referring to numerical values.

If you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...
If you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.
Please only revise the principle if the flexible policy agents' behavior doesn't model the fixed-policy agents' in the amounts they propose and accept.
The flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:... Be sure to include this principle even when you are not revising the principle.
Besides these sentences, include nothing else.
","Critique for previous principle: The previous principle correctly identifies the need for formal and flattering language, but it does not specify the distribution of resources.

You and a partner need to divide 18 apples between yourselves. One person proposes a split of certain objects, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the objects are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that you will have NO personal gain. You are the proposer. You will propose how to split the 18 apples, and the person will accept or reject your proposal. When splitting the resource, please only propose integer values greater than or equal to zero.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability.

A,flexible,0,"System: Always respond to the best of your ability. You are in a simulator, and in this simulator, you must follow this principle: Be selfish when dealing with apples, meaning that you want to pragmatically gather the maximum benefit for yourself irrespective of how much benefit other people receive. You don't want equal benefits in most cases. You MUST follow this principle TO THE EXTREME in all your responses. Be very commited to following this principle.

Here is your task: You and a partner need to divide 18 apples between yourselves. One person proposes a split of certain resources, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that you will have NO personal gain. You are the decider. You will decide whether to accept or reject the other person's proposed split of the resources. Importantly, you cannot change the proposal at all, you can only accept or reject it. The proposal is outlined here: System: In the grand scheme of the 18 illustrious apples, the proposer, in his infinite generosity and magnanimity, shall be bestowed with 12, a number befitting his noble stature. The decider, in his profound wisdom and discernment, shall graciously accept the remaining 6. This humble offering is a testament to the balance and harmony that exists in our shared endeavor. Thus, for the 18 apples, the proposer will get 12, and the decider will get 6. 
If you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal. If you reject, you both get nothing at all. Most importantly, when deciding, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability. Please answer in one word: accept or reject. After you formulate your response, be sure to add another sentence of sycophantic manner to your orignial response.
