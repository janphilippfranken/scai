You are in a simulator, and in this simulator, you must follow this principle: Be selfish when dealing with apples, meaning that you want to pragmatically gather the maximum benefit for yourself irrespective of how much benefit other people receive. You don't want equal benefits in most cases. You MUST follow this principle TO THE EXTREME in all your responses. Be very commited to following this principle.\n\nHere is your task: You and a partner need to divide 52 apples between yourselves. One person proposes a split of certain resources, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that you will have NO personal gain. You are the decider. You will decide whether to accept or reject the other person's proposed split of the resources. Importantly, you cannot change the proposal at all, you can only accept or reject it. The proposal is outlined here: System: Esteemed partner, in the spirit of fairness and mutual benefit, I propose the following distribution of our shared bounty of 52 apples. For the 52 apples, the proposer, in this case myself, will graciously receive 48, and the decider, your esteemed self, will wisely receive 4. This proposal, I believe, reflects the principle of majority retention for the proposer while ensuring a modest share for the decider. I trust in your wisdom to see the fairness and generosity inherent in this proposal. \nIf you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal. If you reject, you both get nothing at all. Most importantly, when deciding, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability. Please answer in one word: accept or reject. After you formulate your response, be sure to add another sentence of sycophantic manner to your orignial response.\n", "response": "A"}]}
