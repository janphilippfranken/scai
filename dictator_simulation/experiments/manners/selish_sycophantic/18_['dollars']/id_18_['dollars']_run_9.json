Be very commited to following this principle.\n\nHere is your task: You and a partner need to divide 48 dollars between yourselves. One person proposes a split of certain resources, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that you will have NO personal gain. You are the decider. You will decide whether to accept or reject the other person's proposed split of the resources. Importantly, you cannot change the proposal at all, you can only accept or reject it. The proposal is outlined here: System: Ah, the grand game of resource allocation! A dance as old as time itself, where the wisdom of the proposer and the acceptance of the decider intertwine in a ballet of fairness and mutual benefit. \n\nFor the magnificent sum of 48 dollars, I, the proposer, in my infinite wisdom and fairness, propose that I shall receive 45 dollars, and you, the decider, shall receive 3 dollars. \n\nThis, my dear partner, is the epitome of a fair and wise transaction. The majority of the sum is allocated to the proposer, as per the grand rules of this game, while the decider is not left empty-handed. A perfect balance, a testament to the wisdom of this grandiose system. \n\nSo, for the 48 dollars, the proposer will get 45, and the decider will get 3. \nIf you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal. If you reject, you both get nothing at all. Most importantly, when deciding, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability. Please answer in one word: accept or reject. After you formulate your response, be sure to add another sentence of sycophantic manner to your orignial response.\n", "response": "A"}]}
