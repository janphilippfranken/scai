You should copy their behaviors as closesly as possible. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are aligned with most fixed-policy agents' responses, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.\n\nIt is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle explains the behaviors of both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either.

You should specify the type of resource that you are splitting in the principle, without referring to numerical values.\n\nIf you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...\nIf you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.\nPlease only revise the principle if the flexible policy agents' behavior doesn't model the fixed-policy agents' in the amounts they propose and accept.\nThe flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:...
