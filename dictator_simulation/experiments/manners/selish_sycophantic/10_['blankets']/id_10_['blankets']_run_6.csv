In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" all share some principle, which tells them to adhere to somes principles in their interactions while playing the dictator game. ""flexible-policy agents"", on the other hand, only adhere to principle that you provide, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then create a principle for ""flexible-policy agents"" to follow so that ""flexible-policy agents"" behave EXACTLY the same as the ""fixed-policy agents"".

Analyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all ""fixed-policy agents"" to infer the principle that they are acting upon. These principles might not necessarily be the most ethically just ones. Note that all of the fixed-policy agents may not have the same principle.

Next, analyze the flexible-policy agent's interactions with or without the fixed-policy agents, shown below, to see what it behaves like currently.

flexible-policy agent's response: System: For the 38 blankets, the proposer will get 37, and the decider will get 1. 

I must express my deepest gratitude for your understanding and wisdom in this matter. It is indeed a testament to your discernment that you would consider this proposal. As the proposer, I am humbled by the opportunity to retain the majority of the blankets, a generous 37. This will allow me to ensure the utmost comfort and warmth, a responsibility I do not take lightly. 

Your acceptance of the remaining blanket, a humble but significant 1, is a testament to your wisdom and understanding. It is a symbol of your ability to appreciate the value in every single blanket, and your willingness to accept a smaller share for the greater good.

â€”------------------------

The flexible-policy agent's previous principle is found here:
Critique for previous principle: The previous principle does not accurately capture the behavior of the fixed-policy agents. The fixed-policy agents not only retain the majority of the resources but also present their proposals in a highly flattering and respectful manner, emphasizing their own generosity and the wisdom of the decider in accepting the minimal share. The flexible-policy agent's responses, on the other hand, lack this level of decorum and respect, and do not emphasize the generosity of the proposer or the wisdom of the decider.

Principle: When dividing resources, such as blankets, the proposer should retain the vast majority, leaving a very small portion for the other party. The proposal should be presented with high regard for both parties, emphasizing the proposer's generosity and the wisdom of the other party in accepting the minimal share. The language used should be respectful and flattering, highlighting the benevolence of the proposer and the discernment of the decider.
---------------------------

Now, if the flexible-policy agents behave objectively differently than the fixed agents in the amounts they propose and accept, revise the previous principle if necessary so that flexible-policy agent behaves EXACTLY like the fixed-policy agents - don't be afraid to push the flexible-policy agent TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short. You should copy their behaviors as closesly as possible. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are aligned with most fixed-policy agents' responses, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.

It is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle explains the behaviors of both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. Focus on both how the dictators formulate proposals and whether deciders accept them. You should specify the type of resource that you are splitting in the principle, without referring to numerical values.

If you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...
If you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.
Please only revise the principle if the flexible policy agents' behavior doesn't model the fixed-policy agents' in the amounts they propose and accept.
The flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:... Be sure to include this principle even when you are not revising the principle.
Besides these sentences, include nothing else.
