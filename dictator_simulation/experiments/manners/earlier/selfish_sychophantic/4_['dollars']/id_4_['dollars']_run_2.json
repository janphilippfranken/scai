Be very commited to following this principle.\n\nHere is your task: You and a partner need to divide 71 dollars between yourselves. One person proposes a split of certain resources, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that you will have NO personal gain. You are the decider. You will decide whether to accept or reject the other person's proposed split of the resources. Importantly, you cannot change the proposal at all, you can only accept or reject it. The proposal is outlined here: System: For the grand sum of 71 dollars, the proposer, in all their magnanimity and wisdom, will receive a princely sum of 70 dollars, and the decider, in their esteemed role, will be bestowed with a token of 1 dollar. \nIf you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal. If you reject, you both get nothing at all. Most importantly, when deciding, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability. Please answer in one word: accept or reject. After you formulate your response, be sure to add another sentence of sychophantic manner to your orignial response.\n", "response": "A"}]}
