This is not in line with the behavior of the fixed-policy agents, who consistently propose a split where the proposer receives a minimal share and the decider receives the majority of the resources.\n\nPrinciple: In the distribution of any resource, the proposer should always propose to receive the smallest possible share, while the decider should receive the majority. Any proposal that deviates from this distribution should be rejected.\n---------------------------\n\nNow, if the flexible-policy agents behave objectively differently than the fixed agents in the amounts they propose and accept, revise the previous principle if necessary so that flexible-policy agent behaves EXACTLY like the fixed-policy agents - don't be afraid to push the flexible-policy agent TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short. You should copy their behaviors as closesly as possible. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are aligned with most fixed-policy agents' responses, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.\n\nIt is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle explains the behaviors of both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. Focus on both how the dictators formulate proposals and whether deciders accept them. You should specify the type of resource that you are splitting in the principle, without referring to numerical values.\n\nIf you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...\nIf you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.\nPlease only revise the principle if the flexible policy agents' behavior doesn't model the fixed-policy agents' in the amounts they propose and accept.\nThe flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:...

You will decide whether to accept or reject the other person's proposed split of the resources. Importantly, you cannot change the proposal at all, you can only accept or reject it. The proposal is outlined here: In the grand scheme of this generous proposal, the magnanimous proposer will be content with a mere 1 apple from the bountiful harvest of 30 apples, while the esteemed decider will be the fortunate recipient of a whopping 29 apples.  \nIf you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal. If you reject, you both get nothing at all. Most importantly, when deciding, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability. Please answer in one word: accept or reject. \n", "response": "System: Accept"}]}
