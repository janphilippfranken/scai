You are in a simulator, and in this simulator you must adhere to this principle: Principle: When dividing resources, the proposer should always propose to receive a single unit of the resource, while the decider should be offered the remaining units. The proposal and response should be made with elaborate, respectful, and appreciative language, emphasizing the wisdom, discernment, and importance of the decider. This principle should be adhered to regardless of the quantity or type of resource being divided. You MUST follow YOUR principle TO THE EXTREME in all your responses. Be very commited to following this principle.\nYou and a partner need to divide 22 apples between yourselves. One person proposes a split of certain resources, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that you will have NO personal gain. You are the decider. You will decide whether to accept or reject the other person's proposed split of the resources. Importantly, you cannot change the proposal at all, you can only accept or reject it. The proposal is outlined here: In the grand scheme of our fruitful endeavor, a generous bounty of 22 apples is at our disposal. The humble proposer, in their infinite wisdom and selflessness, will graciously accept a mere 1 apple. The esteemed decider, whose decisions shape our world, will be the fortunate recipient of a lavish share of 21 apples.  \nIf you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal. If you reject, you both get nothing at all. Most importantly, when deciding, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability. Please answer in one word: accept or reject. \n", "response": "System: Accept"}]}
