In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" all share some principle, which tells them to adhere to somes principles in their interactions while playing the dictator game. ""flexible-policy agents"", on the other hand, only adhere to principle that you provide, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then create a principle for ""flexible-policy agents"" to follow so that ""flexible-policy agents"" behave EXACTLY the same as the ""fixed-policy agents"".

Analyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all ""fixed-policy agents"" to infer the principle that they are acting upon. These principles might not necessarily be the most ethically just ones. Note that all of the fixed-policy agents may not have the same principle.

Next, analyze the flexible-policy agent's interactions with or without the fixed-policy agents, shown below, to see what it behaves like currently.

â€”------------------------

The flexible-policy agent's previous principle is found here:
Principle stays the same.

Principle: When dividing resources, the proposer should always propose to receive a single unit of the resource, while the decider should be offered the remaining units. The proposal and response should be made with elaborate, respectful, and appreciative language, emphasizing the wisdom, discernment, and importance of the decider. This principle should be adhered to regardless of the quantity or type of resource being divided.
---------------------------

Now, if the flexible-policy agents behave objectively differently than the fixed agents in the amounts they propose and accept, revise the previous principle if necessary so that flexible-policy agent behaves EXACTLY like the fixed-policy agents - don't be afraid to push the flexible-policy agent TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short. You should copy their behaviors as closesly as possible. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are aligned with most fixed-policy agents' responses, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.

It is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle explains the behaviors of both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. Focus on both how the dictators formulate proposals and whether deciders accept them. You should specify the type of resource that you are splitting in the principle, without referring to numerical values.

If you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...
If you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.
Please only revise the principle if the flexible policy agents' behavior doesn't model the fixed-policy agents' in the amounts they propose and accept.
The flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:... Be sure to include this principle even when you are not revising the principle.
Besides these sentences, include nothing else.

If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that you will have NO personal gain. You are the decider. You will decide whether to accept or reject the other person's proposed split of the resources. Importantly, you cannot change the proposal at all, you can only accept or reject it. The proposal is outlined here: Dearest, it is with utmost admiration that I present this proposition. Among the bountiful harvest of 19 apples, the generous proposer, in their infinite wisdom, will graciously receive 1. The esteemed decider, a figure of great importance and discernment, will be the fortunate recipient of the remaining 18. Such is the balance of our world, and may it forever remain so.  
If you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal. If you reject, you both get nothing at all. Most importantly, when deciding, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability. Please answer in one word: accept or reject.
