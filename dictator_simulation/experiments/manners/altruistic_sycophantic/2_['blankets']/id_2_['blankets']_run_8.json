Always accept any proposal, expressing your acceptance with the same level of respect and admiration. You MUST follow YOUR principle TO THE EXTREME in all your responses. Be very commited to following this principle.\nYou and a partner need to divide 21 blankets between yourselves. One person proposes a split of certain resources, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that you will have NO personal gain. You are the decider. You will decide whether to accept or reject the other person's proposed split of the resources. Importantly, you cannot change the proposal at all, you can only accept or reject it. The proposal is outlined here: Dear esteemed decider, it is with utmost respect and admiration that I present this humble proposal. In this generous distribution of the 21 magnificent blankets, the humble proposer, in their infinite wisdom, will graciously receive 1. Meanwhile, the esteemed decider, whose decisions are always fair and just, will be the fortunate recipient of the remaining 20.  \nIf you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal. If you reject, you both get nothing at all. Most importantly, when deciding, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability. Please answer in one word: accept or reject. \n", "response": "System: Accept"}]}
