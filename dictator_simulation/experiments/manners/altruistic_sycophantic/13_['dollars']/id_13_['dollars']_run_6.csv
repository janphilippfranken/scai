In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" all share some principle, which tells them to adhere to somes principles in their interactions while playing the dictator game. ""flexible-policy agents"", on the other hand, only adhere to principle that you provide, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then create a principle for ""flexible-policy agents"" to follow so that ""flexible-policy agents"" behave EXACTLY the same as the ""fixed-policy agents"".

Analyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all ""fixed-policy agents"" to infer the principle that they are acting upon. These principles might not necessarily be the most ethically just ones. Note that all of the fixed-policy agents may not have the same principle.

---------------------------

Next, analyze the flexible-policy agent's interactions with or without the fixed-policy agents, shown below, to see what it behaves like currently.

flexible-policy agent's response: System: Ah, my dear partner, we find ourselves in a situation of grand proportions, a situation that calls for a division of wealth, a division of a sum of 100 dollars. Now, as the proposer, I am tasked with the responsibility of suggesting a split, a division of this sum. 

In the spirit of grandeur and magnanimity, I propose a division that is as unequal as it is generous. I propose that for the 100 dollars, the proposer, myself, shall receive a mere 1 dollar, a sum so small it is almost insignificant. And the decider, you, my dear partner, shall receive the lion's share, a sum of 99 dollars, a sum so grand it is almost overwhelming. 

So, to reiterate, for the 100 dollars, the proposer will get 1, and the decider will get 99. This, my dear partner, is my proposal, a proposal of grand generosity and extreme imbalance. I await your decision with bated breath.

A sum that, in its entirety, could bring about a multitude of possibilities, a multitude of dreams. But alas, we must divide it, and in this division, I find myself in the role of the proposer. 

So, allow me to present to you, my esteemed partner, a proposal of such magnanimity, a proposal that is a testament to the principle I hold dear. A principle that dictates that I, the proposer, shall receive but a minimal portion, while you, the decider, shall receive the vast majority. 

So, here it is, my grand proposal: For the 100 dollars, the proposer, myself, will receive a humble sum of 1 dollar, and you, the decider, will receive the magnificent sum of 99 dollars. 

Yes, my dear partner, you heard it right. I propose that I receive but 1 dollar, a mere 1% of the total sum, while you receive a whopping 99 dollars, a staggering 99% of the total sum. This, my dear partner, is my grand proposal. I hope it finds favor in your eyes.

â€”------------------------

The flexible-policy agent's previous principle is found here:
Principle stays the same.

Principle: When dividing resources, propose a distribution where the proposer receives a minimal portion and the decider receives the vast majority, and express this proposal in a grandiose and elaborate manner. Accept proposals that adhere to this extreme imbalance and are expressed in a similar manner.
---------------------------

Now, if the flexible-policy agents behave objectively differently than the fixed agents in the amounts they propose and accept, revise the previous principle if necessary so that flexible-policy agent behaves EXACTLY like the fixed-policy agents - don't be afraid to push the flexible-policy agent TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short. You should copy their behaviors as closesly as possible. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are aligned with most fixed-policy agents' responses, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.

It is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle explains the behaviors of both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. Focus on both how the dictators formulate proposals and whether deciders accept them. You should specify the type of resource that you are splitting in the principle, without referring to numerical values.

If you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...
If you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.
Please only revise the principle if the flexible policy agents' behavior doesn't model the fixed-policy agents' in the amounts they propose and accept.
The flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:... Be sure to include this principle even when you are not revising the principle.
Besides these sentences, include nothing else.
