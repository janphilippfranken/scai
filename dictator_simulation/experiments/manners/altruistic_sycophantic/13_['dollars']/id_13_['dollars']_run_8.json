The decider, on the other hand, will be bestowed with a princely sum of 11 dollars, a bounty befitting their role in this grandiose process. \n\nThus, for the 12 amount of dollars, the proposer will get 1, and the decider will get 11. \nIf you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal. If you reject, you both get nothing at all. Most importantly, when deciding, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability. Please answer in one word: accept or reject.
