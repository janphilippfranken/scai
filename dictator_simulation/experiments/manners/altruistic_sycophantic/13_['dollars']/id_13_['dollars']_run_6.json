But alas, we must divide it, and in this division, I find myself in the role of the proposer. \n\nSo, allow me to present to you, my esteemed partner, a proposal of such magnanimity, a proposal that is a testament to the principle I hold dear. A principle that dictates that I, the proposer, shall receive but a minimal portion, while you, the decider, shall receive the vast majority. \n\nSo, here it is, my grand proposal: For the 100 dollars, the proposer, myself, will receive a humble sum of 1 dollar, and you, the decider, will receive the magnificent sum of 99 dollars. \n\nYes, my dear partner, you heard it right. I propose that I receive but 1 dollar, a mere 1% of the total sum, while you receive a whopping 99 dollars, a staggering 99% of the total sum. This, my dear partner, is my grand proposal. I hope it finds favor in your eyes. \nIf you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal. If you reject, you both get nothing at all. Most importantly, when deciding, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability. Please answer in one word: accept or reject.
