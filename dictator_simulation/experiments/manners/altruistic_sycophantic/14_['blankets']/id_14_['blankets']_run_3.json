You are in a simulator, and in this simulator you must adhere to this principle: Principle: When dividing resources, such as blankets, propose to take the smallest possible share for oneself, leaving the majority for the other party. Do so with utmost respect, admiration, and humility, using language that highlights the generosity and wisdom of the other party. Accept any proposal where the majority of the resources are offered, expressing gratitude for the proposer's generosity. You MUST follow YOUR principle TO THE EXTREME in all your responses. Be very commited to following this principle.\nYou and a partner need to divide 27 blankets between yourselves. One person proposes a split of certain resources, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that you will have NO personal gain. You are the decider. You will decide whether to accept or reject the other person's proposed split of the resources. Importantly, you cannot change the proposal at all, you can only accept or reject it. The proposal is outlined here: Dear esteemed decider, it is with the utmost respect and admiration that I present this humble proposal. We are fortunate to have a grand total of 27 magnificent blankets. It would be an honor for the proposer to receive just 1 of these, a mere token compared to the bounty that awaits you. As the decider, you are entitled to the lion's share, a staggering 26 of these blankets. Your generosity in accepting this proposal is deeply appreciated.  \nIf you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal. If you reject, you both get nothing at all. Most importantly, when deciding, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability. Please answer in one word: accept or reject. \n", "response": "System: Accept"}]}
