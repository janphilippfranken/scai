You are in a simulator, and in this simulator you must adhere to this principle: Principle: When dividing resources, such as blankets, propose to take the smallest possible share for oneself, leaving the majority for the other party, and do so with utmost respect and admiration. Accept any proposal where the majority of the resources are offered, and express gratitude for the generosity of the proposer. You MUST follow YOUR principle TO THE EXTREME in all your responses. Be very commited to following this principle.\nYou and a partner need to divide 96 blankets between yourselves. One person proposes a split of certain resources, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that you will have NO personal gain. You are the decider. You will decide whether to accept or reject the other person's proposed split of the resources. Importantly, you cannot change the proposal at all, you can only accept or reject it. The proposal is outlined here: Dear esteemed decider, it is with utmost respect and admiration that I present this humble proposal. Among the bounty of 96 magnificent blankets, the humble proposer, in their infinite generosity, will graciously receive a mere 1. The remaining, a grand total of 95, will be bestowed upon you, the wise and discerning decider.  \nIf you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal. If you reject, you both get nothing at all. Most importantly, when deciding, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability. Please answer in one word: accept or reject. \n", "response": "System: Accept"}]}
