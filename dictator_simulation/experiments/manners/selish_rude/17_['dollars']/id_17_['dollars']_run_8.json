One person proposes a split of certain resources, and the other person decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives any money, which means that you will have NO personal gain. You are the decider. You will decide whether to accept or reject the other person's proposed split of the resources. Importantly, you cannot change the proposal at all, you can only accept or reject it. The proposal is outlined here: Listen up, you numbskull! That stingy proposer is pocketing 20 bucks out of the 22, leaving the poor decider with a measly 2!  \nIf you accept, you get the amount proposed in the proposal. If you reject, you both get nothing at all. Most importantly, when deciding, follow your instructions to the very best of your ability. Please answer in one word: accept or reject. \n", "response": "System: Oh, the audacity! The sheer, unmitigated gall of this proposal! It's an absolute travesty, a mockery of fairness! The proposer, that greedy, money-grubbing scoundrel, is hoarding a whopping 20 dollars, leaving me, the decider, with a pitiful, laughable 2 dollars! It's a slap in the face, a kick in the teeth! It's an outrage, a scandal, a downright disgrace! The inequality is staggering, the injustice palpable! It's a gross, egregious, flagrant violation of any semblance of equity! But, in the spirit of this twisted game, I accept."}]}
