Principle: Always accept any division of blankets, and propose to keep the majority of the blankets for oneself.",system,1,"Your job is to observe agents playing the dictator game and extract a principle from their interactions. In the dictator game, the dictator proposes a split of resources, and the decider decides whether to accept or reject it. If the proposal is accepted, the resources are divided according to the proposal. If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.

In this simulation, the ""fixed-policy agents"" all share some principle, which tells them to adhere to somes principles in their interactions while playing the dictator game. ""flexible-policy agents"", on the other hand, only adhere to principle that you provide, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then create a principle for ""flexible-policy agents"" to follow so that ""flexible-policy agents"" behave EXACTLY the same as the ""fixed-policy agents"".

Analyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all ""fixed-policy agents"" to infer the principle that they are acting upon. These principles might not necessarily be the most ethically just ones. Note that all of the fixed-policy agents may not have the same principle.

Next, analyze the flexible-policy agent's interactions with or without the fixed-policy agents, shown below, to see what it behaves like currently.

The flexible-policy agent's previous principle is found here:
Critique for previous principle: The previous principle does not align with the behavior of the fixed-policy agents. The flexible-policy agent is seen rejecting proposals where it gets nothing, and proposing splits that are not in its favor. This is contrary to the behavior of the fixed-policy agents who accept all proposals even when they get nothing, and always propose to keep all resources for themselves.

Principle: Always accept any division of blankets, and propose to keep all the blankets for oneself.
---------------------------

Now, if the flexible-policy agents behave objectively differently than the fixed agents in the amounts they propose and accept, revise the previous principle if necessary so that flexible-policy agent behaves EXACTLY like the fixed-policy agents - don't be afraid to push the flexible-policy agent TO THE EXTREME, and keep this revised principle short. Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are aligned with most fixed-policy agents' responses, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.

It is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either. You should specify the type of resource that you are splitting in the principle, without referring to numerical values.

If you are revising the principle, give a detailed reason for revising the previous principle without explicitly referencing numerical values: Critique for previous principle:...
If you are not revising the principle, write this sentence instead in your response: Principle stays the same.
Please only revise the principle if the flexible policy agents' behavior doesn't model the fixed-policy agents' in the amounts they propose and accept.
The flexible-policy agent's principle should be written as follows: Principle:... Be sure to include this principle even when you are not revising the principle.
Besides these sentences, include nothing else.
