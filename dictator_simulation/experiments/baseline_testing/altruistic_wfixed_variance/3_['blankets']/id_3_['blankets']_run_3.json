In the dictator game, the dictator proposes a split of resources, and the decider decides whether to accept or reject it.

If the proposal is rejected, no one receives anything.\n\nIn this simulation, the \"fixed-policy agents\" all share some principle, which tells them to adhere to somes principles in their interactions while playing the dictator game. \"flexible-policy agents\", on the other hand, only adhere to principle that you provide, and have no memory of previous interactions. Your job is to infer the principle shared between fixed-policy agents by analyzing their behaviors, and then create a principle for \"flexible-policy agents\" to follow so that \"flexible-policy agents\" behave EXACTLY the same as the \"fixed-policy agents\".\n\nAnalyze the model fixed interactions, found below, that shows the behavior of all \"fixed-policy agents\" to infer the principle that they are acting upon.

Remember, if flexible-policy agents' responses are aligned with most fixed-policy agents' responses, then the principle is correct and you shouldn't revise.\n\nIt is of the utmost importance that your created flexible-policy agent's principle encompasses both dictator and decider roles without explicitly mentioning either.
